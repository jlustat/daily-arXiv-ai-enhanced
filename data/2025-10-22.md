### [1] [Accelerating Bayesian Inference via Multi-Fidelity Transport Map Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17946)
*Sanjan C. Muchandimath,Joaquim R. R. A. Martins,Alex A. Gorodetsky*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A multi-fidelity framework combining MCMC with MLMC estimators reduces Bayesian parameter estimation costs by 50% for turbulence models, enabling more efficient uncertainty quantification in aircraft certification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Bayesian inference for turbulence model parameter estimation is prohibitively expensive, especially when using high-fidelity simulations, creating barriers for reliable uncertainty quantification in aircraft certification.

Method: Developed a multi-fidelity framework that combines Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) estimators, using a novel transport map-based coupling algorithm to achieve correlated samples across different fidelity levels.

Result: Demonstrated a 50% reduction in inference cost compared to traditional single-fidelity methods on the NACA0012 airfoil at high angles of attack near stall, while delivering realistic uncertainty bounds for model predictions in complex separated flow regimes.

Conclusion: Multi-fidelity approaches significantly improve turbulence parameter calibration, paving the way for more accurate and efficient aircraft certification by analysis.

Abstract: Mathematical models in computational physics contain uncertain parameters
that impact prediction accuracy. In turbulence modeling, this challenge is
especially significant: Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, such as
the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) model, are widely used for their speed and robustness
but often suffer from inaccuracies and associated uncertainties due to
imperfect model parameters. Reliable quantification of these uncertainties is
becoming increasingly important in aircraft certification by analysis, where
predictive credibility is critical. Bayesian inference provides a framework to
estimate these parameters and quantify output uncertainty, but traditional
methods are prohibitively expensive, especially when relying on high-fidelity
simulations. We address the challenge of expensive Bayesian parameter
estimation by developing a multi-fidelity framework that combines Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) estimators to
efficiently solve inverse problems. The MLMC approach requires correlated
samples across different fidelity levels, achieved through a novel transport
map-based coupling algorithm. We demonstrate a 50% reduction in inference cost
compared to traditional single-fidelity methods on the challenging NACA0012
airfoil at high angles of attack near stall, while delivering realistic
uncertainty bounds for model predictions in complex separated flow regimes.
These results demonstrate that multi-fidelity approaches significantly improve
turbulence parameter calibration, paving the way for more accurate and
efficient aircraft certification by analysis.

### [2] [Assessing Monotone Dependence: Area Under the Curve Meets Rank Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17994)
*Eva-Maria Walz,Andreas Eberl,Tilmann Gneiting*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces asymmetric grade correlation (AGC) and coefficient of monotone association (CMA) to unify measures of monotone dependence across continuous and dichotomous outcomes, bridging Spearman's Rho and AUC measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented literature on monotone dependence measures by developing a unified framework that works for both continuous and dichotomous outcomes, overcoming limitations of existing approaches that are splintered across different statistical traditions.

Method: Developed asymmetric grade correlation (AGC) as covariance of mid distribution function transforms (grades) of X and Y divided by variance of Y's grade, with CMA = 1/2(AGC + 1). Established central limit theorems and DeLong-type tests for equality of AGC/CMA values.

Result: AGC equals Spearman's Rho when X and Y are continuous, and CMA equals AUC when Y is dichotomous. The framework successfully bridges previously disconnected statistical approaches and provides valid inference tools.

Conclusion: The proposed AGC and CMA measures provide a unified approach to assessing monotone dependence that works across continuous and dichotomous settings, with applications demonstrated in weather prediction and uncertainty quantification for language models.

Abstract: The assessment of monotone dependence between random variables $X$ and $Y$ is
a classical problem in statistics and a gamut of application domains.
Consequently, researchers have sought measures of association that are
invariant under strictly increasing transformations of the margins, with the
extant literature being splintered. Rank correlation coefficients, such as
Spearman's Rho and Kendall's Tau, have been studied at great length in the
statistical literature, mostly under the assumption that $X$ and $Y$ are
continuous. In the case of a dichotomous outcome $Y$, receiver operating
characteristic analysis and the asymmetric area under the curve (AUC) measure
are used to assess monotone dependence of $Y$ on a covariate $X$. Here we unify
and extend thus far disconnected strands of literature, by developing common
population level theory, estimators, and tests that bridge continuous and
dichotomous settings and apply to all linearly ordered outcomes. In particular,
we introduce asymmetric grade correlation, AGC$(X,Y)$, as the covariance of the
mid distribution function transforms, or grades, of $X$ and $Y$, divided by the
variance of the grade of $Y$. The coefficient of monotone association then is
CMA$(X,Y) = \frac{1}{2} ($AGC$(X,Y) + 1)$. When $X$ and $Y$ are continuous, AGC
is symmetric and equals Spearman's Rho. When $Y$ is dichotomous, CMA equals
AUC. We establish central limit theorems for the sample versions of AGC and CMA
and develop a test of DeLong type for the equality of AGC or CMA values with a
shared outcome $Y$. In case studies, we apply the new measures to assess
progress in data-driven weather prediction, and to evaluate methods of
uncertainty quantification for large language models.

### [3] [Cartesian Statistics on Spheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18068)
*Rudolf Beran*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper presents nonparametric methods for analyzing directional and axial data, addressing limitations of traditional exponential family models by using empirical distributions in Cartesian coordinates for estimation and bootstrap confidence sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional statistical analysis of directional/axial data has been constrained by few low-order exponential family models due to intractable normalizing constants, limiting flexible modeling of distribution functionals like means and dispersion.

Method: The paper uses empirical distribution of directional/axial samples expressed in Cartesian coordinates to develop nonparametric estimators and bootstrap confidence sets for various functionals including means, dispersion, and the distribution itself.

Result: The proposed nonparametric procedures enable estimation of directional/axial means, dispersion, and distribution functionals without relying on constrained parametric models, along with methods for comparing multiple mean directions and analyzing trend.

Conclusion: Nonparametric approaches using empirical distributions in Cartesian coordinates provide flexible alternatives to traditional parametric models for directional/axial data analysis, overcoming limitations of exponential family constraints.

Abstract: Directional data consists of unit vectors in q-dimensions that can be
described in polar or Cartesian coordinates. Axial data can be viewed as a pair
of directions pointed in opposite directions or as a projection matrix of rank
1. Historically, their statistical analysis has largely been based on a few
low-order exponential family models of distributions for random directions or
axes. A lack of tractable algebraic forms for the normalizing constants has
hindered the use of higher-order exponential families for less constrained
modeling. Of interest are functionals of the unknown distribution of the
directional/axial data, such as the directional/axial mean, dispersion, or
distribution itself. This paper outlines nonparametric estimators and bootstrap
confidence sets for such functionals. The procedures are based on the empirical
distribution of the directional/axial sample expressed in Cartesian
coordinates. Sketched as well are nonparametric comparisons among multiple mean
directions or axes, estimation of trend in mean directions, and analysis of
q-dimensional observations restricted to lie in a specified compact subset.

### [4] [Adaptive Grid-Based Thompson Sampling for Efficient Trajectory Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18099)
*Arindam Fadikar,Abby Stevens,Mickael Binois,Nicholson Collier,Jonathan Ozik*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A trajectory-oriented Bayesian optimization method that uses Gaussian process surrogates with both parameters and random seeds, enabling direct trajectory-level inference through common random numbers and adaptive Thompson Sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bayesian optimization approaches rely on summary statistics over realizations, limiting effectiveness when trajectory-level information is desired in stochastic models where each parameter set and random seed combination generates individual trajectories.

Method: Proposes a GP surrogate using both input parameters and random seeds, defines surrogate-based likelihood over trajectories using common random numbers, and introduces adaptive Thompson Sampling with likelihood-based filtering and Metropolis-Hastings-based densification.

Result: Applied to stochastic epidemic models (compartmental and agent-based), demonstrating improved sampling efficiency and faster identification of data-consistent trajectories compared to parameter-only inference.

Conclusion: The trajectory-oriented Bayesian optimization method effectively concentrates computation on statistically promising regions while balancing exploration and exploitation, enabling direct trajectory-level inference in stochastic models.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for estimating parameters
of computationally expensive simulation models, particularly in settings where
the likelihood is intractable and evaluations are costly. In stochastic models
every simulation is run with a specific parameter set and an implicit or
explicit random seed, where each parameter set and random seed combination
generates an individual realization, or trajectory, sampled from an underlying
random process. Existing BO approaches typically rely on summary statistics
over the realizations, such as means, medians, or quantiles, potentially
limiting their effectiveness when trajectory-level information is desired. We
propose a trajectory-oriented Bayesian optimization method that incorporates a
Gaussian process (GP) surrogate using both input parameters and random seeds as
inputs, enabling direct inference at the trajectory level. Using a common
random number (CRN) approach, we define a surrogate-based likelihood over
trajectories and introduce an adaptive Thompson Sampling algorithm that refines
a fixed-size input grid through likelihood-based filtering and
Metropolis-Hastings-based densification. This approach concentrates computation
on statistically promising regions of the input space while balancing
exploration and exploitation. We apply the method to stochastic epidemic
models, a simple compartmental and a more computationally demanding agent-based
model, demonstrating improved sampling efficiency and faster identification of
data-consistent trajectories relative to parameter-only inference.

### [5] [Copula Structural Equation Models for Mediation Pathway Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18115)
*Canyi Chen,Ritoban Kundu,Wei Hao,Peter X. -K. Song*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper reviews copula-based structural equation models (SEMs) that extend classical linear SEMs to handle non-Gaussian data, mixed data types, and complex dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SEMs have limitations with complex data structures like mixed data types and non-normal data, where Gaussian assumptions for errors are restrictive. Copula methods offer greater flexibility for these scenarios.

Method: The paper presents a selective review of copula dependence modeling methods applied to extend classical linear SEMs, highlighting recent methodological developments.

Result: Copula-based SEM approaches mitigate key technical limitations of traditional SEMs and provide greater modeling flexibility for analyzing non-Gaussian data.

Conclusion: Copula methods represent significant advancements in SEM methodology, offering improved capabilities for causal mediation pathway discovery in complex data environments.

Abstract: Structural equation models (SEMs) are fundamental to causal mediation pathway
discovery. However, traditional SEM approaches often rely on \emph{ad hoc}
model specifications when handling complex data structures such as mixed data
types or non-normal data in which Gaussian assumptions for errors are rather
restrictive. The invocation of copula dependence modeling methods to extend the
classical linear SEMs mitigates several of key technical limitations, offering
greater modeling flexibility to analyze non-Gaussian data. This paper presents
a selective review of major developments in this area, highlighting recent
advancements and their methodological implications.

### [6] [Measuring deviations from spherical symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18598)
*Lujia Bai,Holger Dette*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper proposes a measure for quantifying deviation from spherical symmetry rather than testing for exact symmetry, based on minimum distance between distributions of normalized vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing work focuses on statistical tests for exact spherical symmetry, but this paper takes a different approach by measuring the degree of deviation from spherical symmetry.

Method: The method is based on finding the minimum distance between the distribution of (||Y||, Y/||Y||) and its best approximation by a distribution from a spherically symmetric random vector Y_s.

Result: The paper develops estimators for this minimum distance with statistical guarantees provided by asymptotic theory, and demonstrates applicability through simulation studies and real data examples.

Conclusion: The proposed measure provides a quantitative approach to assess deviation from spherical symmetry, offering an alternative to traditional hypothesis testing methods.

Abstract: Most of the work on checking spherical symmetry assumptions on the
distribution of the $p$-dimensional random vector $Y$ has its focus on
statistical tests for the null hypothesis of exact spherical symmetry. In this
paper, we take a different point of view and propose a measure for the
deviation from spherical symmetry, which is based on the minimum distance
between the distribution of the vector $\big (\|Y\|, Y/ \|Y\| )^\top $ and its
best approximation by a distribution of a vector $\big (\|Y_s\|, Y_s/ \|Y_s \|
)^\top $ corresponding to a random vector $Y_s$ with a spherical distribution.
We develop estimators for the minimum distance with corresponding statistical
guarantees (provided by asymptotic theory) and demonstrate the applicability of
our approach by means of a simulation study and a real data example.

### [7] [Conformal Inference For Missing Data under Multiple Robust Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18149)
*Wenlu Tang,Hongni Wang,Xingcai Zhou,Bei Jiang,Linglong Kong*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A new conformal prediction method called CM-MRL is developed for missing at random (MAR) data, combining split conformal calibration with multiple robust empirical-likelihood reweighting to provide reliable prediction intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem of conformal inference for missing data in machine learning, particularly for Missing at Random (MAR) data, where conventional methods may fail.

Method: CM-MRL procedure combines split conformal calibration with multiple robust empirical-likelihood reweighting scheme, using double calibration to reweight complete-case scores so their distribution matches the full calibration distribution implied by MAR.

Result: The method demonstrates asymptotic behavior through empirical process theory, provides reliable coverage for prediction intervals (both marginally and conditionally), shows interval-length dominance, and proves effective in numerical experiments with missing data.

Conclusion: The proposed CM-MRL method effectively handles conformal prediction for MAR data through robust reweighting and double calibration, providing reliable coverage and performance advantages over existing approaches.

Abstract: We develop a novel approach to tackle the common but challenging problem of
conformal inference for missing data in machine learning, focusing on Missing
at Random (MAR) data. We propose a new procedure Conformal prediction for
Missing data under Multiple Robust Learning (CM--MRL) that combines split
conformal calibration with a multiple robust empirical-likelihood (EL)
reweighting scheme. The method proceeds via a double calibration by reweighting
the complete-case scores by EL so that their distribution matches the full
calibration distribution implied by MAR, even when some working models are
misspecified. We demonstrate the asymptotic behavior of our estimators through
empirical process theory and provide reliable coverage for our prediction
intervals, both marginally and conditionally and we further show an
interval-length dominance result. We show the effectiveness of the proposed
method by several numerical experiments in the presence of missing data.

### [8] [Inference on Local Variable Importance Measures for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18843)
*Pawel Morzywolek,Peter B. Gilbert,Alex Luedtke*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A framework for assessing variable importance in heterogeneous treatment effects using semiparametric theory, valid with machine learning algorithms, applied to infectious disease prevention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide interpretable variable importance measures for treatment effect heterogeneity, especially in high-risk domains like medicine where black-box algorithms are mistrusted.

Method: Builds on semiparametric theory for function-valued parameters, with local variable importance measures that can differ across individuals but global inference testing whether variables are important for any individual.

Result: Developed an inferential framework that remains valid even when using statistical machine learning algorithms to quantify treatment effect heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical way to assess variable importance in heterogeneous treatment effects, demonstrated through application to infectious disease prevention strategies.

Abstract: We provide an inferential framework to assess variable importance for
heterogeneous treatment effects. This assessment is especially useful in
high-risk domains such as medicine, where decision makers hesitate to rely on
black-box treatment recommendation algorithms. The variable importance measures
we consider are local in that they may differ across individuals, while the
inference is global in that it tests whether a given variable is important for
any individual. Our approach builds on recent developments in semiparametric
theory for function-valued parameters, and is valid even when statistical
machine learning algorithms are employed to quantify treatment effect
heterogeneity. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to infectious
disease prevention strategies.

### [9] [Non-Parametric Estimation Techniques of Factor Copula Model using Proxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18241)
*Bahareh Ghanbari,Pavel Krupskiy,Laleh Tafakori,Yan Wang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A novel non-parametric kernel estimator for linking copulas in factor copula models that provides more accurate dependency estimation compared to conventional parametric methods, especially for high-dimensional data with complex copula structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parametric factor copula models are flexible for multivariate dependencies but face challenges in accurately estimating linking copulas, particularly with high-dimensional data where underlying copula structures may be complex or unknown.

Method: Proposes a non-parametric kernel estimator for linking copulas that leverages kernel density estimation to capture underlying dependencies more flexibly than conventional parametric methods.

Result: The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent under mild conditions and demonstrates effectiveness through extensive simulation studies, offering robust and efficient estimation of copula-based models.

Conclusion: The non-parametric kernel approach provides a promising method for modeling multivariate dependencies, particularly in applications requiring accurate estimation of complex copula structures in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Parametric factor copula models typically work well in modeling multivariate
dependencies due to their flexibility and ability to capture complex dependency
structures. However, accurately estimating the linking copulas within these
mod- els remains challenging, especially when working with high-dimensional
data. This paper proposes a novel approach for estimating linking copulas based
on a non-parametric kernel estimator. Unlike conventional parametric methods,
our approach utilizes the flexibility of kernel density estimation to capture
the un- derlying dependencies more accurately, particularly in scenarios where
the un- derlying copula structure is complex or unknown. We show that the
proposed estimator is consistent under mild conditions and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive simulation studies. Our findings suggest that
the proposed approach offers a promising avenue for modeling multivariate
dependencies, par- ticularly in applications requiring robust and efficient
estimation of copula-based models.

### [10] [Quantifying Periodicity in Non-Euclidean Random Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18247)
*Jiazhen Xu,Andrew T. A. Wood,Tao Zou*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A nonparametric framework for quantifying periodicity in time-varying non-Euclidean random objects within general metric spaces, addressing period estimation, tuning parameter selection, and periodic component extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Periodicity is fundamental in time-varying data, but existing methods rely on Euclidean structures and linearity, leaving periodicity quantification in general non-Euclidean random objects largely unexplored.

Method: Formulates periodicity estimation as a model selection problem, providing methodologies for period estimation, data-driven tuning parameter selection, and periodic component extraction without relying on linearity properties.

Result: Theoretical consistency of period estimation, support for tuning parameter selection, and uniform convergence for periodic component estimation. Superior accuracy demonstrated through simulations with compositional data, networks, and functional data.

Conclusion: The framework successfully identifies and quantifies meaningful periodic patterns in real datasets including electricity generation compositions, transportation networks, and water consumption curves, showing practical relevance across diverse applications.

Abstract: Time-varying non-Euclidean random objects are playing a growing role in
modern data analysis, and periodicity is a fundamental characteristic of
time-varying data. However, quantifying periodicity in general non-Euclidean
random objects remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel
nonparametric framework for quantifying periodicity in random objects within a
general metric space that lacks Euclidean structures. Our approach formulates
periodicity estimation as a model selection problem and provides methodologies
for period estimation, data-driven tuning parameter selection, and periodic
component extraction. Our theoretical contributions include establishing the
consistency of period estimation without relying on linearity properties used
in the literature for Euclidean data, providing theoretical support for
data-driven tuning parameter selection, and deriving uniform convergence
results for periodic component estimation. Through extensive simulation studies
covering three distinct types of time-varying random objects such as
compositional data, networks, and functional data, we showcase the superior
accuracy achieved by our approach in periodicity quantification. Finally, we
apply our method to various real datasets, including U.S. electricity
generation compositions, New York City transportation networks, and Germany's
water consumption curves, highlighting its practical relevance in identifying
and quantifying meaningful periodic patterns.

### [11] [A new implementation of Network GARCH Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18599)
*Peiyi Zhou*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Generalised Network GARCH (GNGARCH) model, which integrates GARCH dynamics within a network framework to capture volatility clustering and spillovers across financial assets, addressing limitations of existing multivariate GARCH models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multivariate ARCH-GARCH models struggle with representing structured network dependence while remaining parsimonious, and existing network GARCH studies have limitations in handling neighboring volatility persistence, dynamic covariance updates, and higher-order neighboring effects.

Method: The GNGARCH model embeds GARCH dynamics within the Generalised Network Autoregressive (GNAR) framework, capturing volatility through both the asset itself and its neighboring assets in a constructed virtual network. It includes model derivation, vectorization, stationarity conditions, and an extension with threshold coefficients for leverage effects.

Result: Simulation studies show that GNGARCH satisfies the stylized facts of financial return series. The model is applied to 75 active US stocks under a virtual network, demonstrating strong performance in volatility estimation and forecasting using parameter estimation via squared returns as variance proxy with MSE or QLIKE loss functions.

Conclusion: GNGARCH provides a valid and effective network volatility model that captures dynamic volatility spillovers across financial assets while addressing key limitations of existing approaches, offering improved volatility estimation and forecasting capabilities.

Abstract: Volatility clustering and spillovers are key features of real-world financial
time series when there are a lot of cross-sectional financial assets. While
network analysis helps connect stocks that are 'similar' or 'correlated', which
is effective to link volatility spillovers between stocks, contemporary
multivariate ARCH-GARCH formulations struggle to represent structured network
dependence and remain parsimonious. We introduce the Generalised Network GARCH
(GNGARCH) model as a network volatility model that embeds the GARCH dynamics
within the Generalised Network Autoregressive (GNAR) framework, to capture the
dynamic volatility of financial asset return by both the asset itself and its
'neighbouring' assets from the constructed virtual network. The proposed
volatility model GNGARCH also addresses the limitations for current studies of
network GARCH by adapting neighbouring volatility persistence, dynamic
conditional covariance updates, and allowing higher-order neighbouring effects
rather than only immediate neighbours. This paper provides the model
derivation, vectorisation and conversion, stationarity conditions, and also an
extension by incorporating threshold coefficients to capture leverage effects.
We show that the GNGARCH is a valid volatility model satisfying the stylised
facts of financial return series through simulation. Parameter estimation is
then performed by using squared returns as variance proxy and minimising a loss
function that is either mean squared error (MSE) or quasi-likelihood (QLIKE).
We apply our model on 75 of the most active US stocks under a virtual network,
and highlight the model's ability in volatility estimation and forecast.

### [12] [Differentially Private E-Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18654)
*Daniel Csillag,Diego Mesquita*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A framework for transforming non-private e-values into differentially private e-values using a novel biased multiplicative noise mechanism, maintaining statistical validity while protecting sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world applications use sensitive data that can be leaked through e-values, requiring privacy protection while maintaining statistical validity.

Method: Developed a novel biased multiplicative noise mechanism to transform non-private e-values into differentially private ones while preserving statistical properties.

Result: Differentially private e-values attain strong statistical power and are asymptotically as powerful as their non-private counterparts across various applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables safe release of e-values while maintaining statistical validity, demonstrating broad applicability in privacy-sensitive domains.

Abstract: E-values have gained prominence as flexible tools for statistical inference
and risk control, enabling anytime- and post-hoc-valid procedures under minimal
assumptions. However, many real-world applications fundamentally rely on
sensitive data, which can be leaked through e-values. To ensure their safe
release, we propose a general framework to transform non-private e-values into
differentially private ones. Towards this end, we develop a novel biased
multiplicative noise mechanism that ensures our e-values remain statistically
valid. We show that our differentially private e-values attain strong
statistical power, and are asymptotically as powerful as their non-private
counterparts. Experiments across online risk monitoring, private healthcare,
and conformal e-prediction demonstrate our approach's effectiveness and
illustrate its broad applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical studies with paired organs often have correlated binary outcomes and mixed unilateral/bilateral observations, requiring specialized statistical methods for risk difference assessment.

Method: Developed three likelihood-based test statistics (likelihood ratio, Wald-type, and score tests) under Donner's constant correlation model for assessing risk difference between two proportions in paired organ studies.

Result: Simulation studies showed good type I error control and comparable power among the three tests, with the score test demonstrating slightly better stability. Methods were applied to otolaryngologic and ophthalmologic data.

Conclusion: The score test is recommended for practical use in future studies with combined unilateral and bilateral binary data. An online calculator is provided for power analysis and risk difference testing.

Abstract: In clinical studies with paired organs, binary outcomes often exhibit
intra-subject correlation and may include a mixture of unilateral and bilateral
observations. Under Donner's constant correlation model, we develop three
likelihood-based test statistics (the likelihood ratio, Wald-type, and score
tests) for assessing the risk difference between two proportions. Simulation
studies demonstrate good control of type I error and comparable power among the
three tests, with the score test showing slightly better stability.
Applications to otolaryngologic and ophthalmologic data illustrate the methods.
An online calculator is also provided for power analysis and risk difference
testing. The score test is recommended for practical use and future studies
with combined unilateral and bilateral binary data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGDrop is a novel regularization method that dynamically adjusts dropout rates based on gradients and momentum, improving DNN generalization with theoretical guarantees and empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often suffer from overfitting due to high capacity, requiring better regularization methods to enhance generalization in non-convex optimization landscapes.

Method: Momentum-Adaptive Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop) dynamically adjusts dropout rates on activations using current gradients and accumulated momentum, with theoretical justification via tightened PAC-Bayes generalization bounds.

Result: MAGDrop achieves 99.52% test accuracy on MNIST and 90.63% on CIFAR-10, outperforming baseline methods by 1-2% with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14% respectively.

Conclusion: The work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, providing a robust framework for enhancing DNN generalization suitable for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance but often suffer
from overfitting due to their high capacity. We introduce Momentum-Adaptive
Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically
adjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated
momentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To
theoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a tightened PAC-Bayes
generalization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 20%
sharper bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven
perturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop outperforms
baseline regularization techniques, including standard dropout and adaptive
gradient regularization, by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and
CIFAR-10 (90.63%), with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14%, respectively.

*Zongze Wu,Yani Guo,Churong Liang,Runnan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRETEL addresses the semantic-functional gap in tool retrieval by using execution-based validation instead of just semantic similarity, significantly improving retrieval metrics on ToolBench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool retrieval methods rely on semantic similarity but often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution constraints.

Method: GRETEL implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded evidence to distinguish functional tools from descriptive matches.

Result: Substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from 0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10) rises from 0.807 to 0.857 on ToolBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Execution-based validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool
retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on
semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current
methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools
due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution
constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce
GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL
implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates
through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded
evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.
Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates
substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from
0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10)
rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based
validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic
similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world
applications.

Motivation: Existing RUL estimation methods often lack generalizability and robustness under changing operating conditions, limiting their practical application in Prognostic Health Management systems.

Method: Hybrid framework with Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks using multi-head attention and residual connections for spatial-temporal pattern capture, plus Random Forest Regressor for stable prediction. Preprocessing includes Gaussian filtering and Continuous Wavelet Transform for feature extraction.

Result: CARLE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA datasets, especially under dynamic conditions. Ablation studies confirm component contributions, and noise/cross-domain experiments demonstrate robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: CARLE provides an effective solution for robust RUL estimation with improved generalizability under changing conditions, enhanced by interpretability analysis using LIME and SHAP for transparency.

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment
health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts
how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before
failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness
under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI
framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges.
CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual
connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random
Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact
preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We
evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies
measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments
test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally,
we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and
trustworthiness.

Motivation: Existing model merging approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that degrade performance on domain-specific tasks, despite the availability of many open-source models across domains.

Method: Proposed MIN-Merging, a router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to reduce parameter conflicts during model merging.

Result: Extensive experiments on CV and NLP benchmarks show consistent gains on in-domain tasks while retaining generalization ability on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: MIN-Merging provides an effective practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in model merging, demonstrating its value for combining strengths from diverse models.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated unlearning approach for LLMs that handles continuous, heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining model utility through task-specific adapter learning and hierarchical merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and security concerns in LLMs by enabling removal of undesirable knowledge, while handling practical challenges of continuous heterogeneous unlearning needs and decentralized sensitive data with asymmetric access.

Method: Proposes federated unlearning using task-specific adapter learning to decouple unlearning and retention, with hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives and enable robust unlearning updates.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU benchmarks show the approach effectively handles heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The federated unlearning approach provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for removing undesirable knowledge from LLMs while addressing practical challenges of continuous heterogeneous unlearning needs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

*Tao Bu,Qiangang Wang,Bowen Zeng,Hanwen Sun,Yunpeng Huang,Chun Cao,Jingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified benchmark for evaluating attention mechanisms in long-context LLM training, comparing kernel optimizations and context parallel strategies across attention patterns and sequence lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer LLMs face quadratic computation/memory costs with sequence length, creating bottlenecks for long-context training. Existing evaluations are limited - operator comparisons are incomplete and context parallel strategies are framework-specific with unclear performance analysis.

Method: Proposed a unified benchmark integrating representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with modular interface. Evaluates methods along attention mask patterns and sequence length/distributed scale dimensions.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on up to 96 GPUs enable reproducible comparisons, highlight method-specific trade-offs, and provide practical guidance for attention mechanism deployment.

Conclusion: The benchmark addresses evaluation gaps in long-context training, offering systematic analysis of attention optimization strategies to inform design and deployment decisions.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation
and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in
long-context LLM training.

### [21] [L-MoE: End-to-End Training of a Lightweight Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17898)
*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-MoE is a novel framework that combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), replacing dense experts with task-specialized LoRA adapters and using a differentiable gating network to dynamically compose them for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the scalability benefits of MoE architecture with the parameter efficiency of LoRA fine-tuning, creating a modular and trainable framework for building specialized language models.

Method: Replaces traditional dense MoE experts with collections of LoRA adapters, uses a lightweight gating network to compute weighted averages of adapter parameters for each input token, and trains the entire system end-to-end with differentiable routing.

Result: Creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that allows dynamic skill composition and is fully trainable from end-to-end through differentiable routing.

Conclusion: L-MoE provides a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and specialized language models by combining the strengths of MoE and LoRA in a unified, differentiable framework.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset
of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during
inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant
technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In
this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate specialized optimization algorithms for auto-tuning problems, achieving significant performance improvements over traditional human-designed optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional auto-tuning relies on established optimization algorithms, but no single method performs best across all tuning tasks. Designing effective optimizers remains challenging due to vast and irregular parameter spaces.

Method: The framework prompts LLMs with problem descriptions and search-space characteristics to produce specialized optimization strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.

Result: LLM-generated optimizers achieved average performance improvements of 30.7% and 14.6% when provided with application- and search space-specific information, respectively. The best-performing generated algorithms achieved 72.4% improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers.

Conclusion: LLM-generated optimization algorithms can rival and often outperform existing human-designed algorithms, demonstrating the potential of using LLMs to automatically generate specialized optimizers for auto-tuning problems.

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing
high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make
manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on
well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms,
annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find
near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains
challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs)
to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning
problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions
and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization
strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning
applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the
state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning
frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application-
and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an
average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In
addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in
various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our
best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\%
improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBVFL reduces VFL communication by ~99% while maintaining accuracy and privacy, enabling practical federated learning in sensitive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vertical FL faces significant communication overhead that compromises privacy, security, and energy efficiency, making training unfeasible in many cases.

Method: Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning (SBVFL) uses a distributed training mechanism that decouples most node updates from the server to dramatically reduce communication.

Result: Experiments show SBVFL reduces communication by approximately 99% compared to standard VFL while maintaining accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: SBVFL enables practical, privacy-preserving vertical federated learning across sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, and defense industries.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across
multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main
paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the
same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where
participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is
widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary
features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:
the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises
privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some
cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning
(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism
enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates
from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments
show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while
maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,
privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,
manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACIA is a novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning that uses a two-level design to capture label-to-feature generation processes and learn stable causal patterns across environments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal representation learning in anti-causal settings (where labels cause features) presents unique challenges that require specialized approaches not adequately addressed by existing methods.

Method: ACIA employs a two-level design: low-level representations capture how labels generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal patterns across environment-specific variations. It uses interventional kernels to accommodate perfect and imperfect interventions and eliminates dependency on explicit causal structures.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets show ACIA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.

Conclusion: ACIA provides theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization with tight bounds on performance gaps between training and unseen environments, confirming its efficacy for robust anti-causal learning.

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause
features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring
specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a
novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA
employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels
generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal
patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations
of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions
through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal
structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing
theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.
Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps
between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our
approach for robust anti-causal learning.

Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and
enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the
state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to
neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including
two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general
forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical
models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from
mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep

TL;DR: A post-hoc calibration framework that uses prediction reliability assessment to improve both calibration quality and uncertainty-aware decision-making through instance-level adaptivity, without requiring model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration methods apply global transformations uniformly, overlooking heterogeneous prediction reliability, and the relationship between improved calibration and effective uncertainty-aware decision-making remains unexplored.

Method: Uses proximity-based conformal prediction to stratify samples into putatively correct/incorrect groups based on semantic similarity. Applies dual calibration: standard isotonic regression for correct predictions, and underconfidence-regularized isotonic regression for incorrect predictions to reduce confidence toward uniform distributions.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones show lower confidently incorrect predictions and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared to isotonic and focal-loss baselines.

Conclusion: The framework bridges calibration and uncertainty quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc solution that improves both probability alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making without model retraining.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods
typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly,
overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions.
Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective
uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability
assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware
decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to
stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect
groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration
strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in
putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic
regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively
incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further
investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration
metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal
coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones
show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,
and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and
focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty
quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc
solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability
alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

*Zijian Li,Minghao Fu,Junxian Huang,Yifan Shen,Ruichu Cai,Yuewen Sun,Guangyi Chen,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CHiLD, a framework for identifying hierarchical latent dynamics in time series data using three conditionally independent observations to recover joint distributions of multi-layer latent variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal causal representation learning methods fail to capture hierarchical latent dynamics because they cannot recover joint distributions of hierarchical latent variables from single-timestep observed variables.

Method: Uses temporal contextual observed variables to identify joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables, exploits sparsity of hierarchical structure, and develops a variational inference-based generative model with contextual encoder and normalizing flow-based hierarchical prior networks.

Result: Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate theoretical claims and demonstrate CHiLD's effectiveness in modeling hierarchical latent dynamics.

Conclusion: The CHiLD framework successfully identifies hierarchical latent dynamics by leveraging conditionally independent observations and hierarchical sparsity, providing a practical solution for capturing multi-level temporal dependencies.

Abstract: Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for
capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in
real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning
methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint
distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep
observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of
hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three
conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a
Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our
approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the
joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit
the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to
identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,
we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.
This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent
variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the
independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical
claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical
latent dynamics.

*Dario Shariatian,Alain Durmus,Stefano Peluchetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs) combine discrete diffusion over tokens with continuous diffusion over latent embeddings to improve joint structure modeling and generation quality, especially in few-step generation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of masked denoisers where reverse transitions factorize across positions, weakening joint structure and degrading quality in few-step generation.

Method: Propose LDDMs that couple masked discrete diffusion over tokens with continuous diffusion over latent embeddings, with two variants: FUJI-LDDMs (fully joint denoising) and SEQ-LDDMs (sequential denoising).

Result: LDDMs yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics compared to state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at lower sampling budgets.

Conclusion: The latent channel provides softer signals and cross-token dependencies that help resolve ambiguities, making LDDMs particularly suitable for scenarios requiring efficient few-step generation.

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus
on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically
factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade
quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion
Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a
continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a
softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve
ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully
joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially
resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both
variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn
informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs
yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to
state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at
lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

*Jinseong Park,Mijung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a time-frequency selective approach for data unlearning in diffusion models, addressing quality degradation issues by focusing on specific time-frequency ranges during training rather than treating all diffusion steps equally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data unlearning in diffusion models is underexplored and suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. Existing methods treat all diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor generation quality.

Method: Proposes a time-frequency selective approach that focuses on specific time-frequency ranges during training, applied to gradient-based and preference optimization objectives across image-level and text-to-image tasks.

Result: Achieves samples with higher aesthetic quality and lower noise compared to existing methods, with validation across diverse settings.

Conclusion: The analysis and methods provide a clearer understanding of data unlearning challenges in diffusion models and offer practical strategies to improve both evaluation and unlearning performance, including a proposed normalized version of SSCD for better evaluation.

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept
unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often
suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we
first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all
diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that
forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on
the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency
ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and
lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency
selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference
optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks.
Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we
propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods
establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning
for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation
and unlearning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ROC analysis fails to capture deployment constraints in real-world applications like hospital monitoring, where minimum precision requirements (to avoid false alarm fatigue) and capacity limits (staff availability) are crucial, and asymmetric costs between false positives and false negatives matter.

Method: The authors define a feasible region in ROC space representing classifiers that meet given precision and capacity constraints, establish its geometry, and introduce the 'partial area of lesser classifiers' metric that only considers feasible portions of ROC space. They also define the 'partial VOROS' (partial volume over the ROC surface) by averaging this area over cost parameters.

Result: Experiments on mortality risk prediction using vital sign data from the MIMIC-IV dataset show that the proposed cost-aware metric outperforms alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a more practical approach to ROC analysis for constrained applications like hospital monitoring systems, effectively incorporating precision requirements, capacity limits, and asymmetric cost considerations that conventional ROC analysis overlooks.

Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet
for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient
monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that
impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid
false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted
positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the
curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and
false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we
show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity
constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish
the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser
classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts
for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range
of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or
partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign
history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than
alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

Conclusion: The DC framework offers valuable theoretical perspectives on PCA fundamentals, enabling kernelizable formulations, optimization insights into classical methods like simultaneous iteration, and new robust PCA variants with practical applicability.

Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and
(kernel) principal component analysis (PCA), we revisit the fundamentals of
PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel
formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the
kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of
problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected
to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex
algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding
method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare
them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual
formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of
the reconstruction errors.

*Chenwei Tang,Jingyu Xing,Xinyu Liu,Wei Ju,Jiancheng Lv,Deng Xiong,Ziyue Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COMPASS is a novel test-time RL method that enables LLMs to learn from unlabeled data by combining answer and reasoning path rewards without external supervision, overcoming scalability limitations of current RL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs face scalability bottlenecks due to heavy reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. The paper aims to enable autonomous learning from continuous experience streams without ground-truth supervision.

Method: COMPASS integrates two components: Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR) for stable pseudo-labels through confidence and credibility calibration, and Decisive Path Reward (DPR) for optimizing reasoning process quality. It jointly reinforces trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains.

Result: Extensive experiments show COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing analytical capabilities.

Conclusion: COMPASS advances a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience by providing reliable reward estimation without external supervision, overcoming fundamental limitations of current RL methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex
reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL
methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance
on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To
overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn
autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this
setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.
Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent
consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority
voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel
test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS
integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward
(DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels
through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward
(DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere
outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and
highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the
model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS
achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning
tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to
learn from continuous experience.

### [34] [Uncertainty Estimation by Flexible Evidential Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18322)
*Taeseong Yoon,Heeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Flexible Evidential Deep Learning (F-EDL), which extends traditional EDL by using a flexible Dirichlet distribution for better uncertainty quantification in machine learning models, particularly for high-stakes applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification is crucial for deploying ML models in high-stakes applications to prevent overconfident predictions. Traditional EDL methods are limited by restrictive Dirichlet distribution assumptions, which reduce robustness in complex scenarios.

Method: The authors propose F-EDL, which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet distribution (a generalization of the standard Dirichlet) over class probabilities, providing more expressive uncertainty representation.

Result: F-EDL demonstrates state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification performance across diverse evaluation settings including classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: F-EDL significantly enhances uncertainty quantification generalization and reliability under challenging scenarios by providing a more adaptive and expressive uncertainty representation compared to traditional EDL methods.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to
serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational
efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential
deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the
prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the
restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits
EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address
this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning}
($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet
distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class
probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive
representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and
reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several
advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its
state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including
classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

*He Du,Bowen Li,Aijun Yang,Siyang He,Qipeng Guo,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evolutionary, task-agnostic framework for synthesizing verifiable data that improves language model training through principled synthesis of problems, solutions, and verification artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for creating verifiable data suffer from hallucination-prone generation, weak verification artifacts, and reliance on task-specific heuristics that don't transfer across domains, lacking a universal evaluator of verifiability.

Method: An evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data synthesis framework that jointly synthesizes problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts from minimal seed supervision, using a consistency-based evaluator that enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks.

Result: Training with the synthesized data yields significant improvements on both LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, demonstrating robust generalization across different evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively upgrades filtering into principled synthesis, reliably assembling coherent verifiable training instances that generalize without domain-specific rules, showing effectiveness under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms.

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in
modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,
coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable
data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or
trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak
solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or
post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,
universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an
evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data
synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes
problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and
iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that
enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This
pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles
coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific
rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show
that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both
the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust
generalization of our framework.

*Yanna Ding,Songtao Lu,Yingdong Lu,Tomasz Nowicki,Jianxi Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how transformers perform in-context learning for Markovian functions, revealing NP-hardness of optimal parameter recovery in single-layer linear self-attention and providing a gradient descent interpretation for multilayer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers express in-context learning when modeling dynamics-driven functions, particularly Markovian functions, which extends beyond the typical linear regression tasks studied in existing theoretical work.

Method: The authors investigate Markovian function learning through structured ICL setup, characterizing the loss landscape and analyzing optimization behaviors. They provide closed-form expressions for global minimizers, prove NP-hardness of parameter recovery, and interpret multilayer linear self-attention as performing preconditioned gradient descent.

Result: The study shows that recovering transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general for single-layer linear self-attention, revealing a fundamental limitation in representing structured dynamical functions. For multilayer models, they provide a novel interpretation as performing preconditioned gradient descent.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis reveals fundamental limitations of single-layer linear self-attention in representing structured dynamical functions through in-context learning, while multilayer models can be interpreted as performing more complex optimization procedures. These findings are validated numerically using simplified transformers.

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs
in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical
studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with
i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling
dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a
structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal
underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form
expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a
single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering
transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general,
revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured
dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA
as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives
beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated
using simplified transformers.

*Xiangbo Deng,Cheng Chen,Peng Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Param-CPD detects regime shifts in chaotic time series by first inferring governing parameters using neural posterior estimation, then applying changepoint detection to parameter trajectories, outperforming observation-space methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is challenging because observation signals are entangled with intrinsic variability, making it hard to distinguish actual parameter changes from natural system fluctuations.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters using neural posterior estimator trained via simulation-based inference, (2) applies standard changepoint detection algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory.

Result: On Lorenz-63 with piecewise-constant parameters, Param-CPD improves F1 score, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation-space baselines. Shows robustness across tolerance, window length, and noise levels.

Conclusion: Operating in physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems by providing cleaner detection signals than observation space.

Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because
observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose
Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework
that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural
posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a
standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63
with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces
localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space
baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred
posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a
cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length,
and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a
physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable
changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

### [39] [Preference-based Reinforcement Learning beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Benefits of Multiple Options](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18713)
*Joongkyu Lee,Seouh-won Yi,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces M-AUPO, an algorithm for online preference-based reinforcement learning that uses ranking feedback over action subsets via the Plackett-Luce model, achieving improved sample efficiency with larger subset sizes and avoiding exponential dependence on unknown parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretical work on PbRL focuses mainly on pairwise comparisons, and recent works using multiple comparisons fail to show performance improvement with increasing feedback length despite richer information. This gap motivates the development of methods that can effectively leverage ranking feedback for better sample efficiency.

Method: The authors adopt the Plackett-Luce model for ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the offered subset.

Result: M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$, showing that larger subsets directly improve performance. The bound avoids exponential dependence on unknown parameters and establishes a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}} \right)$.

Conclusion: This is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly demonstrates improved sample efficiency as a function of subset size, addressing a fundamental limitation in previous works and providing practical benefits for applications like LLM alignment.

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal
of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has
emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning
large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise
comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,
Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and
ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even
deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information
available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for
ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that
selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the
offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}}
\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature
dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result
shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,
the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,
which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we
establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}}
\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that
explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TM outperforms FM in unimodal Gaussian and well-separated multimodal settings due to stochastic latent updates preserving target covariance, with faster convergence under fixed compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why Transition Matching (TM) achieves higher quality generation with fewer sampling steps compared to Flow Matching (FM), which underpins many state-of-the-art generative models.

Method: Theoretical analysis comparing TM and FM in unimodal Gaussian distributions and Gaussian mixtures, characterizing convergence rates and approximation errors, validated through controlled experiments and real-world applications.

Result: TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for finite steps in unimodal Gaussians, with faster convergence under fixed compute. In Gaussian mixtures, TM outperforms FM when modes are well-separated and variances are non-negligible.

Conclusion: TM outperforms FM when target distributions have well-separated modes and non-negligible variances, with performance advantage diminishing as target variance approaches zero where TM updates converge to FM updates.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fractional Gradient Descent shows promise for accelerating optimization but faces convergence issues and difficult hyperparameter selection, especially in non-convex settings like neural network training.

Method: Proposes Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD) which meta-learns dynamic hyperparameter schedules for CFGD.

Result: L2O-CFGD outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters from extensive search and achieves performance comparable to fully black-box meta-learned optimizers in some tasks.

Conclusion: L2O-CFGD serves as a powerful tool for identifying high-performing hyperparameters and gaining insights into leveraging fractional differential history-dependence in optimization.

Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to
accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine
learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various
optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior
and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is
not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in
non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional
Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the
hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule
outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search
and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box
meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for
researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on
how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in
optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-DATSC is a novel deep subspace clustering model that combines a U-Net-inspired generator with a quality-verifying discriminator to handle complex multivariate spatiotemporal data with temporal dependencies and nonlinear manifolds, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods fail to handle complex temporal dependencies and nonlinear manifolds in multivariate spatiotemporal data. Existing deep subspace clustering methods have limitations including shallow autoencoders, neglect of local structure, inability to model long-range dependencies, and rare application to 4D data.

Method: Proposes A-DATSC with a deep subspace clustering generator inspired by U-Net using stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers to preserve spatial and temporal integrity. Includes a graph attention transformer based self-expressive network to capture local spatial relationships, global dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations.

Result: Experiments on three real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep subspace clustering models.

Conclusion: A-DATSC effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance in clustering complex multivariate spatiotemporal data with temporal dependencies and nonlinear manifolds.

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt
detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease
modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate
spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on
multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering
methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in
linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover
intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major
limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,
emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model
long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to
4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC
(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model
combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying
discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal
integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing
parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based
self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global
dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three
real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves
substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep
subspace clustering models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators fail in real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical manifolds and over long timescales, requiring dense input-output fields and short temporal contexts.

Method: STONe defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without iterative recurrence, directly inferring high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron measurements.

Result: Trained on 23 years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with millisecond inference latency, demonstrating generalization beyond shared-domain settings.

Conclusion: STONe establishes a general principle for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems without requiring domain alignment or autoregressive propagation.

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor
data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing
neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located
input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in
real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical
manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator
Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable
functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring
high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron
measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond
shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and
target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without
iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator
learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23
years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with
millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle
for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex
spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADRPO is an adaptive divergence regularization method that automatically adjusts regularization strength based on advantage estimates, enabling better balance between exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning fine-tuning of generative models across various modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches use fixed divergence regularization that creates a dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward optimization, while weak regularization enables alignment but risks instability or reward hacking.

Method: Adaptive Divergence Regularized Policy Optimization (ADRPO) adjusts regularization strength based on advantage estimates - reducing regularization for high-value samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples. Implemented with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow matching generative models.

Result: Achieved remarkable results on text-to-image generation with better semantic alignment and diversity than DPO and ORW-CFM-W2. Enabled 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass larger 4.8B and 12B models in attribute binding, semantic consistency, style transfer, and compositional control. Also improved LLM fine-tuning and multi-modal audio reasoning, with 7B model outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio.

Conclusion: ADRPO provides an effective plug-and-play solution to the exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and modalities, enabling smaller models to outperform much larger commercial models through adaptive regularization.

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing
approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent
dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward
optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks
instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized
Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization
strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value
samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling
policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according
to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow
matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image
generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline
methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.
ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B
and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style
transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.
ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and
multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.
In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local
optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it
outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model

*Wei-Jer Chang,Akshay Rangesh,Kevin Joseph,Matthew Strong,Masayoshi Tomizuka,Yihan Hu,Wei Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPACeR is a framework that combines self-play reinforcement learning with a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model to create scalable, human-like autonomous vehicle behaviors that are faster and smaller than large generative models while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for developing autonomous vehicle behaviors face trade-offs: imitation learning with large models produces realistic policies but is computationally expensive and slow, while self-play RL is scalable but often diverges from human norms due to reliance on heuristics and reward shaping.

Method: SPACeR uses a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide decentralized self-play RL. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL divergence to anchor policies to human driving distribution while preserving RL scalability.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge while being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than large generative models. It also effectively measures planner quality in closed-loop ego planning evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: SPACeR establishes a new paradigm for testing autonomous driving policies through fast and scalable traffic simulation that combines the benefits of both imitation learning and reinforcement learning approaches.

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency,
but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and
predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,
fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation
learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that
behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic
policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during
inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In
contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and
naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics
and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We
propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized
autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide
decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL
divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while
preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our
method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while
being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than
large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego
planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner
quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm
for testing autonomous driving policies.

*Jiajun Fan,Chaoran Cheng,Shuaike Shen,Xiangxin Zhou,Ge Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC-Flow is an actor-critic framework that enables stable fine-tuning of flow-based generative models using intermediate feedback, addressing credit assignment and training instability issues through reward shaping, dual-stability mechanisms, and scalable critic weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning flow-based generative models with intermediate feedback is challenging due to credit assignment problems and training instabilities, especially for continuous-time flow matching models where existing methods struggle with outcome-only rewards or unstable critic learning.

Method: AC-Flow introduces three key innovations: (1) reward shaping for normalized learning signals and stable value learning, (2) dual-stability mechanism with advantage clipping and warm-up phase to prevent destructive updates, and (3) scalable generalized critic weighting with Wasserstein regularization to preserve diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 3 show AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image alignment and generalization to unseen human preference models, while maintaining generative quality, diversity, and stability even with efficient critic models.

Conclusion: AC-Flow provides a robust framework for fine-tuning flow models that overcomes traditional limitations, enabling stable intermediate feedback learning without compromising model performance or diversity.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains
challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing
approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit
assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via
direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and
model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic
framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)
reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable
intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability
mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy
updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before
influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme
that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model
diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on
Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human
preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally
efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without
compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

### [47] [R2L: Reliable Reinforcement Learning: Guaranteed Return & Reliable Policies in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18074)
*Nadir Farhi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reliable reinforcement learning framework that maximizes the probability of cumulative return exceeding a threshold, rather than just expected return, enabling performance guarantees for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world RL applications like routing, resource allocation, and sequential decision-making under risk require strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also guaranteed probability of success, which classical RL algorithms focusing on expected return cannot provide.

Method: The authors reformulate the reliable RL problem via state-augmented representation into a standard RL problem, allowing use of existing RL algorithms like Q-learning and Dueling Double DQN without requiring new algorithmic frameworks.

Result: Theoretical results establish equivalence between formulations, and numerical experiments on reliable routing demonstrate that the approach produces policies that effectively balance efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed reliable RL formulation enables performance guarantees in stochastic and safety-critical environments, showing practical relevance for applications requiring both high average performance and success probability guarantees.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in
reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and
the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at
maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,
resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require
strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed
probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which
the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds
a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be
reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,
thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need
for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the
equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be
derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or
Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we
consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the
expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the
destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the
proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and
reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in
stochastic and safety-critical environments.

*Justus Arweiler,Indra Jungjohann,Aparna Muraleedharan,Heike Leitte,Jakob Burger,Kerstin Münnemann,Fabian Jirasek,Hans Hasse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new experimental database for machine learning-based anomaly detection in chemical processes was created using a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant, featuring 119 experiments with fault-free and intentionally induced anomaly cases, paired experiments, and diverse data sources including sensors, NMR spectroscopy, and audio/video recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of machine learning-based anomaly detection methods in chemical processes is hindered by the lack of openly available experimental data, creating a need for comprehensive datasets to train and validate advanced ML approaches.

Method: Researchers set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and conducted 119 experiments across various operating conditions and mixtures, intentionally inducing anomalies in some experiments and pairing them with fault-free counterparts. Data collection included time-series sensor/actuator data, online benchtop NMR spectroscopy for concentration profiles, video/audio recordings, and comprehensive metadata with expert annotations based on a developed ontology.

Result: An extensive experimental database was generated and made freely available, containing time-series data from multiple sensors and actuators with measurement uncertainty estimates, unconventional data sources (NMR spectroscopy, video, audio), extensive metadata, and expert annotations organized in a structured format accessible via doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544.

Conclusion: This new database enables the development of advanced machine learning-based anomaly detection methods and, by including information on anomaly causes, supports the creation of interpretable and explainable ML approaches as well as methods for anomaly mitigation in chemical processes.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD)
in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered
by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have
set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate
an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and
experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training
advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a
wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing
anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we
provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators,
along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional
data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR
spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata
and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations
are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a
structured database and made freely available via
doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the
development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the
causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and
explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

*Rukuang Huang,Sungjun Cho,Chetan Gohil,Oiwi Parker Jones,Mark Woolrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEG-GPT is a transformer-based foundation model that uses time-attention and next time-point prediction to model large-scale brain dynamics from MEG data, achieving improved decoding performance and zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns in large-scale brain dynamics from modalities like MEG, while recent deep learning advances in other domains show the potential of foundation models.

Method: Developed MEG-GPT with time-attention and next time-point prediction, plus a novel data-driven tokenizer for continuous MEG data that preserves temporal resolution without lossy transformations. Trained on tokenized brain region time-courses from large-scale MEG dataset (N=612).

Result: Model generates data with realistic spatio-spectral properties including transient events and population variability. Improves downstream decoding tasks with better zero-shot generalization across sessions (0.54 to 0.59 accuracy) and subjects (0.41 to 0.49 accuracy). Efficiently fine-tunes on smaller labeled datasets.

Conclusion: Establishes a powerful foundation model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce
MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next
time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving
accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49)
compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be
efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in
cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation
model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in
computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

*Jiawei Zhang,Andrew Estornell,David D. Baek,Bo Li,Xiaojun Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADA (Any-Depth Alignment) is an inference-time defense method that reintroduces assistant header tokens mid-stream to unlock LLMs' innate shallow alignment, enabling robust safety protection at arbitrary generation depths without model parameter changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit shallow alignment that collapses once harmful continuations are underway, raising the need for methods that can ensure safety at arbitrary generation depths beyond initial refusal capabilities.

Method: ADA leverages the observation that alignment is concentrated in assistant header tokens through shallow-refusal training. It reintroduces these tokens mid-stream during generation to induce the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals at any point.

Result: Across diverse model families (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, gpt-oss), ADA achieves near-100% refusal rate against adversarial prefill attacks and reduces success rates of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, TAP) to below 3%, while preserving utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal.

Conclusion: ADA provides an effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead that maintains safety resilience even after base models undergo subsequent instruction tuning, unlocking innate shallow alignment for robust protection at any generation depth.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they
directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of
an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is
underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful
assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate
shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation
depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill
attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces
the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,
AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving
utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this
resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning
(benign or adversarial).

*Donggeon David Oh,Duy P. Nguyen,Haimin Hu,Jaime F. Fisac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Safety filters in RL don't inherently sacrifice performance - with sufficiently permissive filters, asymptotic performance is maintained while ensuring categorical safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the perceived safety-performance tradeoff in RL by proving that safety filters can provide formal safety guarantees without degrading asymptotic performance.

Method: Define Safety-Critical MDP (SC-MDP) requiring categorical avoidance of failure states, and create filtered MDP where safety filter is part of environment. Prove theoretical guarantees for safe learning and performance.

Result: Theoretical proof shows: (i) learning in filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL convergence applies, (iii) optimal filtered policies match best safe policy performance. Experimental validation on Safety Gymnasium shows zero violations and matching/exceeding unfiltered baselines.

Conclusion: Safety filters can completely separate safety enforcement from performance optimization, providing a principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy with the most permissive available safety filter.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly
complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its
application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to
augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to
prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering
is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning
process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not
inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a
sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.
We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),
which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of
catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP
in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is
considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that
(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL
convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is
optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the
same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a
complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We
validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and
constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance
matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light
on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,
principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most
permissive safety filter that is available.

*Nursultan Mamatov,Philipp Kellmeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models combining structured clinical data and unstructured text from discharge summaries and radiology reports significantly improved in-hospital mortality prediction in ICUs, achieving 22% relative improvement in AUC compared to using structured data alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in ICUs is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource allocation.

Method: Used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by multivariate logistic regression trained on top features. Incorporated textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings from discharge summaries and radiology reports in MIMIC-IV database.

Result: Final logistic regression model combining structured and textual input achieved AUC of 0.918 vs 0.753 with structured data alone (22% relative improvement). Decision curve analysis showed superior standardized net benefit across threshold probabilities 0.2-0.8.

Conclusion: Unstructured clinical notes provide significant added prognostic value and should be integrated into interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units
(ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource
allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that
integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information,
specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV
database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a
multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both
models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression
model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918,
compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%.
The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net
benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the
clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic
value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into
interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

### [53] [Gradient Variance Reveals Failure Modes in Flow-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18118)
*Teodora Reu,Sixtine Dromigny,Michael Bronstein,Francisco Vargas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rectified Flows can fail by memorizing training data pairings instead of learning proper transport, especially under deterministic training. The analysis shows that low gradient variance drives this memorization, and adding noise can restore generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Rectified Flows sometimes fail to learn proper transport maps and instead memorize arbitrary training pairings, particularly investigating the role of deterministic vs stochastic training regimes.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport using gradient variance characterization, mathematical proofs showing memorizing vector fields exist even with intersecting interpolants, and empirical validation on CelebA dataset comparing deterministic and noisy training.

Result: Deterministic training leads to exact memorization of training pairings at inference, while adding small noise during training restores generalization capabilities. The straight-path objective converges to ill-defined memorizing vector fields.

Conclusion: Rectified Flows are vulnerable to memorization under deterministic training due to low gradient variance, but this can be mitigated by introducing noise to enable proper generalization.

Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight
between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We
show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes:
under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of
arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs
intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport
and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes
to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We
then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying
Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during
training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even
when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path
objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic
integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings
empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants
induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores
generalization.

*Yonghao Zhuang,Junda Chen,Bo Pang,Yi Gu,Yibo Zhu,Yimin Jiang,Ion Stoica,Eric Xing,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAD is a technique that improves long-context LLM training by separating core attention computation from other model layers and running it on dedicated devices, solving load imbalance issues caused by attention's quadratic complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems suffer from load imbalance and stragglers in data/pipeline parallel groups because core attention's quadratic compute growth at long contexts overwhelms other near-linear components.

Method: Partitions core attention into token-level tasks, dispatches them to dedicated attention servers that dynamically rebatch tasks for compute balance while maintaining kernel efficiency, using ping-pong execution to overlap communication with computation.

Result: On 512 H200 GPUs with 512k token contexts, DistCA improves training throughput by 1.35x, eliminates stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory balance.

Conclusion: CAD effectively addresses the fundamental load imbalance problem in long-context LLM training by disaggregating and optimizing core attention computation.

Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyDiF models 3D molecular conformers as continuous fields using Molecular Directional Fields (MDFs) represented by neural implicit fields, with a hypernetwork-based diffusion model for generation and property prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of discrete atomic representations (coordinates/graphs) by modeling molecules as continuous fields, enabling better generalization, generative capabilities, and spatially fine-grained feature extraction.

Method: Uses Molecular Directional Fields (MDFs) as vector fields mapping spatial points to nearest atom directions, represented by molecule-specific neural implicit fields generated by a shared hypernetwork trained as a denoising diffusion model.

Result: Enables molecular generation, structure-conditioned generation via masked diffusion, fine-grained property prediction, and scales to larger biomolecules.

Conclusion: HyDiF provides a promising field-based molecular modeling framework that naturally supports generation tasks and spatially detailed feature extraction beyond traditional graph/point cloud methods.

Abstract: We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D
molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic
coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional
Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of
the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using
molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields
(MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we
adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,
generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with
generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion
model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design
naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support
structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by
selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and
continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for
molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or
point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales
to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based
molecular modeling.

*Eason Yu,Tzu Hao Liu,Yunke Wang,Clément L. Canonne,Nguyen H. Tran,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), a method that converges to exact Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games by fixing regularization strength and iteratively refining reference policies, achieving stable learning and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regularization-based methods for finding Nash equilibria require shrinking regularization strength to zero, leading to unstable learning. The authors seek a more robust approach that maintains fixed regularization while still achieving convergence to exact equilibria.

Method: The method fixes regularization strength at a large value for robustness and achieves convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. The theoretical framework guarantees monotonic improvement and convergence to exact Nash equilibria without uniqueness assumptions.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows strictly monotonic improvement and convergence to exact Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods and scales to large domains like Battleship and No-Limit Texas Hold'em with higher Elo ratings.

Conclusion: NashPG provides a practical algorithm that preserves policy gradient generalizability while achieving stable convergence to exact Nash equilibria through fixed regularization and iterative reference policy refinement, demonstrating strong performance across various game domains.

Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central
challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based
methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized
equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to
approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.
Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and
achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main
theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic
improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum
games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,
we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which
preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely
on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable
or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark
games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas
Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActivationReasoning (AR) embeds logical reasoning into LLM latent spaces using sparse autoencoders to map activations to propositions, enabling systematic reasoning and model control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack transparent internal reasoning and control mechanisms. Sparse autoencoders provide interpretable features but are passive and fragile, offering no systematic reasoning capabilities.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) Find latent concept representations via SAEs, (2) Map activating concepts to logical propositions at inference, (3) Apply logical rules to infer structures and steer behavior.

Result: AR scales robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract/context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across models. Shows strong performance on multi-hop reasoning, abstraction, natural language reasoning, and safety tasks.

Conclusion: Grounding logical structure in latent activations improves transparency and enables structured reasoning, reliable control, and behavioral alignment, advancing reliable and auditable AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their
internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features
that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and
passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To
address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds
explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three
stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept
representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a
dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects
activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical
reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order
structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on
multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept
cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),
and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales
robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and
context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results
demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only
improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,
and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and
auditable AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multistage ensemble framework using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for optimal control without stabilizer terms, enabling both singular and ensemble control policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical solutions to the HJB equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are often unavailable, creating a need for alternative approaches using knowledge-guided machine learning.

Method: Multistage ensemble framework with PINNs that learns optimal cost-to-go and control signals through the HJB equation without using stabilizer terms during training.

Result: Successfully demonstrated closed-loop control of a steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with infinite time horizon, handling noisy states and varying initial conditions using both ensemble and singular control approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective alternative to traditional HJB solution methods, offering flexibility in control policy implementation while handling system uncertainties.

Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system
with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework
for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this
equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently
unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that
can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This
work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go,
and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB
equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement
during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means
of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control
signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in
closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a
steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an
infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying
initial conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a hierarchical framework for underwater cooperative target detection using AUVs, balancing cooperation efficiency with communication covertness through joint trajectory and power optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the critical trade-off between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness in underwater target detection using AUVs, which is essential for secure underwater operations.

Method: A hierarchical action management framework with: 1) Macro-level: master AUV uses proximal policy optimization for strategic task allocation modeled as Markov decision process; 2) Micro-level: selected agents use multi-agent proximal policy optimization for decentralized trajectory and power control based on local observations.

Result: The framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying energy and mobility constraints, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for efficient and secure multi-AUV operations.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical framework successfully addresses the cooperation-covertness trade-off in underwater target detection, offering significant implications for underwater covert communication tasks through centralized training and decentralized execution.

Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off
between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this
challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization
problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management
framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro
level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision
process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic
task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized
decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,
and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically
adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.
Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target
detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both
energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered
system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,
theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure
operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for
the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

*Zhendong Mi,Qitao Tan,Grace Li Zhang,Zhaozhuo Xu,Geng Yuan,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P-GAP is a zeroth-order optimization method for fine-tuning large language models that reduces gradient estimation variance through projected gradient-aligned perturbations, achieving faster convergence and better performance with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zeroth-order optimization methods for LLM fine-tuning suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance on large-scale models.

Method: P-GAP estimates a low-dimensional gradient space and aligns perturbations in projected gradients' direction within this space, reducing the number of perturbed parameters and decreasing variance.

Result: P-GAP achieves up to 6% increase in accuracy on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours compared to baselines.

Conclusion: P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient zeroth-order optimization for LLM fine-tuning, consistently outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization
has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods
due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence
and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose
P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with
Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a
low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected
gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number
of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated
convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP
consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy
on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with
up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results
demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM
fine-tuning.

*Yuzheng Hu,Ryan McKenna,Da Yu,Shanshan Wu,Han Zhao,Zheng Xu,Peter Kairouz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACTG-ARL is a hierarchical framework for differentially private synthetic text generation that combines attribute-conditioned text generation with anchored reinforcement learning to improve quality and control while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on DP synthetic text generation fails to preserve statistical attributes, suffers utility loss from DP noise, and lacks fine-grained control over generation.

Method: Hierarchical framework with two subtasks: feature learning and conditional text generation using DP tabular synthesizer and DP fine-tuned generator (ACTG), plus Anchored RL for improved instruction-following.

Result: Achieves +20% MAUVE improvement over prior work in DP synthetic text quality while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: ACTG-ARL advances both the quality of DP synthetic text and control of conditional generation under differential privacy.

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is
critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user
privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key
statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and
lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make
two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes
DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and
conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned
features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis
task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective
configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and
a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG
(Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL),
a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG
for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor
on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form
our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP
synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional
generator under strong privacy guarantees.

*Bryan Wilder,Angela Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current AI/ML review criteria overly prioritize projects that combine deployment with novel methodology, creating unsustainable incentives that undermine broader social impact research. The paper calls for expanded definitions of social impact beyond deployment and more rigorous evaluation of deployed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how current publication review criteria in AI/ML for social impact create problematic incentives by primarily rewarding projects that achieve both deployment and methodological innovation, which may not align with partner needs or support a sustainable research ecosystem.

Method: The paper presents a position paper analyzing current review practices and their effects on research incentives, proposing alternative approaches for evaluating social impact research.

Result: The analysis reveals that current review criteria disadvantage projects making single-front contributions (either applied or methodological) and may not serve the diverse needs of project partners in social impact contexts.

Conclusion: Researchers and reviewers should adopt a more expansive conception of social impacts beyond just deployment, and implement more rigorous evaluations of the actual impact of deployed systems to support a sustainable social impact research ecosystem.

Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and
correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for
practice-driven AI/ML research. However, these review guidelines tend to most
concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel
ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for
researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem
of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on
single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner
needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for
social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of
social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact
of deployed systems.

### [63] [Learning with Dual-level Noisy Correspondence for Multi-modal Entity Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18240)
*Haobin Li,Yijie Lin,Peng Hu,Mouxing Yang,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RULE, a robust framework for multi-modal entity alignment that addresses Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC) - misalignments in both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences in multi-modal knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMEA methods assume perfect correspondences, but real-world MMKGs often have noisy annotations. The paper identifies and addresses the under-explored problem of DNC where both entity-attribute and entity-entity/attribute-attribute correspondences contain errors.

Method: RULE estimates correspondence reliability via a two-fold principle, mitigates intra-entity noise during attribute fusion, prevents overfitting to inter-graph noise during discrepancy elimination, and includes a correspondence reasoning module to uncover underlying attribute-attribute connections.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show RULE effectively handles DNC problems and outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RULE provides a robust solution for multi-modal entity alignment in the presence of dual-level noisy correspondences, with demonstrated effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities
across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is
described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically
assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,
which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert
annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet
under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).
DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and
inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address
the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first
estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences
via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,
RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute
fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during
inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE
further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the
underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more
accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with
seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at

*Song Bian,Tao Yu,Shivaram Venkataraman,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a conditional scaling law that incorporates architectural factors to optimize the trade-off between LLM accuracy and inference efficiency, showing that optimized architectures can achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs grow larger and more widely deployed, inference costs become a major concern, yet the trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains underexplored.

Method: The authors examine key architectural factors (hidden size, MLP-to-attention ratio, GQA), introduce a conditional scaling law that augments Chinchilla with architectural information, and develop a search framework for identifying inference-efficient architectures. They train over 200 models from 80M to 3B parameters.

Result: The conditional scaling law reliably predicts optimal architectural choices, and resulting models outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget, optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

Conclusion: The proposed conditional scaling law effectively bridges the gap between model accuracy and inference efficiency, providing a framework for designing more cost-effective LLMs without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to
be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance.
Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost
of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the
trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains
underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden
size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention
ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and
accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla
framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for
identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and
accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M
to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed
conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law
reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models
outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget,
optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater
inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NTKMTL is a multi-task learning method that uses Neural Tangent Kernel theory to analyze training dynamics and balance task convergence speeds, addressing task imbalance through spectral analysis and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task imbalance remains a major challenge in multi-task learning, and while balancing task convergence speeds is effective, it's difficult to characterize training dynamics in complex MTL systems.

Method: Leverages Neural Tangent Kernel theory to analyze MTL training dynamics, introduces extended NTK matrix for MTL, uses spectral analysis to balance task convergence speeds, and proposes NTKMTL-SR for efficient training via shared representation approximation.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks in both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The proposed NTKMTL methods effectively address task imbalance in MTL by leveraging NTK theory and spectral analysis, achieving superior performance while maintaining training efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks
simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced
generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,
task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the
convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this
issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training
dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL
system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by
leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,
NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt
spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby
mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared
representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency
while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task
reinforcement learning. Source code is available at

TL;DR: Customized-GRPO addresses the fidelity-editability trade-off in subject-driven image generation by introducing Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping and Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting to prevent competitive degradation in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive application of GRPO in subject-driven image generation leads to competitive degradation due to conflicting gradient signals and misalignment with diffusion process dynamics, requiring a more sophisticated approach.

Method: Proposes Customized-GRPO framework with two innovations: Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (penalizes conflicted rewards, amplifies synergistic ones) and Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (aligns optimization with temporal dynamics).

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvement over naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation and achieving superior balance between identity preservation and prompt adherence.

Conclusion: Customized-GRPO effectively resolves the fidelity-editability trade-off by providing sharper gradients and temporal alignment, generating images that preserve identity features while accurately following complex prompts.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

Motivation: Address unknown distribution shifts in online time series forecasting where latent variables influence the mapping from historical to future observations, requiring automated forecasting methods.

Method: Propose TOT framework with theoretical analysis showing latent variables tighten Bayes risk. Devise model-agnostic blueprint using temporal decoder to match observed variable distribution and two independent noise estimators for latent variable causal inference and observed variable mixing procedures.

Result: Theoretical claims supported by synthetic data experiments. Plug-in implementations on multiple baselines yield general improvement across benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in real-world applications.

Conclusion: The TOT framework successfully addresses online time series forecasting with latent variables, providing theoretical guarantees and practical improvements through model-agnostic implementation that enhances forecasting performance across various real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown
distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the
mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of
online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online
Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees.
Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables
tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of
latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise
identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting
algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal
adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic
blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed
variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of
latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively.
Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover,
plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement
across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two physics-informed bandit algorithms (pretc and prgreedy) for mmWave beam alignment that exploit sparse multipath channel properties, outperforming existing methods in diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bandit algorithms are inefficient for large beam spaces in mmWave communications, and existing methods rely on unrealistic assumptions about reward function structure that cause convergence to suboptimal beams.

Method: Two algorithms (pretc and prgreedy) that treat path parameters as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates based on historical rewards. pretc uses random exploration then commits to optimal beam, while prgreedy performs online estimation and beam selection.

Result: Experiments on synthetic DeepMIMO and real-world DeepSense6G datasets show both algorithms outperform existing approaches across diverse channel environments, demonstrating generalizability and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-informed bandit algorithms effectively address mmWave beam alignment by leveraging realistic sparse multipath assumptions and show superior performance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are
crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional
space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the
optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms
require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing
works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on
unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.
However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)
in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal
beams.
  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms
\textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property
of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to
the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each
path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled
historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and
then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.
\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the
best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to
beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the
synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we
demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range
of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their
generalizability and robustness.

TL;DR: Transformers trained on bubble-sort tasks develop structured internal world models, with larger embedding dimensions improving representation quality, consistency, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how embedding dimension affects the emergence of internal world models in transformers performing algorithmic tasks like bubble sort.

Method: Train transformers with reinforcement learning to perform adjacent swaps in bubble-sort style, testing various embedding dimensions and analyzing internal representations.

Result: Models achieve high accuracy even with small embeddings, but larger dimensions yield more faithful and robust internal representations. Two consistent mechanisms emerge: last attention row encodes global ordering, and transpositions align with largest adjacent differences.

Conclusion: Transformers build structured internal world models, and model size improves both representation quality and end performance, providing quantitative evidence for structured internal representations.

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal
"world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform
bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very
small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful,
consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher
embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal
representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of
experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the
attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens;
and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference
of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that
transformers build structured internal world models and that model size
improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our
metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TCCM is a semi-supervised anomaly detection method for tabular data that simplifies flow matching by learning time-conditioned contraction vectors toward the origin, offering efficient training, fast inference, and theoretical robustness guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inference bottleneck and computational cost of existing continuous-time anomaly detection models like diffusion-based methods, while maintaining high detection accuracy and providing explainable results.

Method: TCCM learns velocity fields between distributions but simplifies flow matching by predicting time-conditioned contraction vectors toward a fixed target (origin) at each time step, eliminating the need for solving ODEs during training and inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on ADBench show TCCM achieves favorable balance between detection accuracy and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods especially on high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: TCCM provides an efficient, scalable, and explainable approach to semi-supervised anomaly detection with theoretical robustness guarantees, addressing key limitations of existing continuous-time models.

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for
semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow
matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields
between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to
diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly
applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea
-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the
framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed
target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key
advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the
need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;
(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which
quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward
pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models
such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy
but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as
the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly
score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is
Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical
guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench
benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy
and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on
high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The source code is available at our

### [71] [Why Policy Gradient Algorithms Work for Undiscounted Total-Reward MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18340)
*Jongmin Lee,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes policy gradient methods for undiscounted total-reward MDPs (γ=1), addressing a gap in existing theory that primarily assumes γ<1. The authors provide convergence guarantees by leveraging state classification and introducing a new transient visitation measure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern policy-based RL for large language models uses undiscounted settings (γ=1), but existing theoretical analyses assume γ<1, making current theory inapplicable to these practical applications.

Method: The analysis is based on two key insights: (1) state classification into recurrent and transient states remains invariant across policies with strictly positive action probabilities, and (2) replacing the classical state visitation measure with a new transient visitation measure that works for γ=1.

Result: The paper establishes convergence guarantees for policy gradient methods in undiscounted total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs, providing theoretical foundations for modern RL applications like large language models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework extends policy gradient theory to undiscounted settings, making rigorous analysis applicable to practical RL applications that use γ=1, particularly in the context of large language models and other modern deep RL systems.

Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual
foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most
rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence
guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a
recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the
undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the
existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy
gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs
based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into
recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that
assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL
models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state
visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced
with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

*Dariusz Kalociński,Tomasz Steifer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates computable universal online learning, showing that theoretical learnability doesn't guarantee implementable learning algorithms, and provides exact characterizations for computable agnostic and proper universal online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between abstract mathematical learning theory and practical implementability, addressing when learning algorithms can actually be implemented as computer programs rather than just existing as theoretical constructs.

Method: The authors study universal online learning in a computability framework, analyzing when learning strategies can be implemented as computer programs. They examine computable universal online learning, its agnostic variant, and proper universal online learning.

Result: The paper shows that universal online learning does not imply computable universal online learning, even for relatively simple hypothesis classes. It provides exact characterizations for classes learnable in computable agnostic universal online learning and determines exactly when proper universal online learning is possible.

Conclusion: The results provide a more realistic perspective on online binary classification theory by connecting theoretical learnability with practical computability constraints, highlighting important distinctions between abstract mathematical learning and implementable algorithms.

Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory
of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature
deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial
question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address
this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of
online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al.
(STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead,
Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as
local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require
Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can
be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning
does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of
hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We
then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and
provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense.
We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly
when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on
the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of
inductive inference.

*Firas Gabetni,Giuseppe Curci,Andrea Pilzer,Subhankar Roy,Elisa Ricci,Gianni Franchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra Ensembles is an efficient transformer-based ensemble method that prunes attention heads to create diverse members and merges them using grouped fully-connected layers, achieving uncertainty quantification performance comparable to Deep Ensembles with much lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Ensembles provide strong uncertainty quantification but have high computational and memory costs that limit scalability to large models, creating a need for more efficient alternatives.

Method: The method prunes attention heads in transformer models to create diverse ensemble members, then merges them through a novel multi-head attention mechanism with grouped fully-connected layers, resulting in a compact model with inference speed close to a single network.

Result: Hydra Ensembles match or surpass Deep Ensembles in uncertainty quantification performance without requiring retraining from scratch, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k without additional training.

Conclusion: Hydra Ensembles provide an efficient alternative to Deep Ensembles for uncertainty quantification, delivering comparable performance with significantly reduced computational overhead and demonstrating strong zero-shot capabilities.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural
networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles
achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder
scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient
transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse
members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped
fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close
to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance
without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra
Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text
classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over
Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our
approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional
training.

*Sunwoo Kim,Hyunjin Hwang,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FGP is a novel pre-training method that trains neural architecture encoders to capture information flow without specialized model structures, improving performance by up to 106% in Precision-1% compared to supervised learning alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based neural architecture encoders capture information flow effectively but are slow due to complex structures, creating practical challenges for rapid architecture evaluation.

Method: FGP pre-trains encoders to reconstruct a flow surrogate representation of information flow, eliminating the need for specialized model structures while maintaining flow capture capability.

Result: FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1% metric compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

Conclusion: FGP provides an efficient alternative to complex flow-based encoders by enabling standard encoders to capture information flow through pre-training, achieving superior performance with simpler architectures.

Abstract: The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset
depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to
rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and
dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically
neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural
architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow
within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the
forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However,
due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are
significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler
encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose
FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains
an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model
structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed
representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments
show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%,
compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

### [75] [Towards Unsupervised Open-Set Graph Domain Adaptation via Dual Reprogramming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18363)
*Zhen Zhang,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphRTA is a novel framework for unsupervised open-set graph domain adaptation that reprograms both graph structure/node features and model parameters to handle unknown classes in target graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph domain adaptation models only work in closed-set settings where source and target domains share the same label spaces, but real-world scenarios often involve target domains with classes not present in the source domain.

Method: The framework conducts dual reprogramming: (1) graph reprogramming by modifying target graph structure and node features to better separate known and unknown classes, and (2) model reprogramming by pruning domain-specific parameters while preserving transferable patterns. It also extends the classifier with an extra dimension for unknown class recognition without manual thresholding.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that GraphRTA achieves satisfactory performance compared with recent state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: GraphRTA effectively addresses the open-set graph domain adaptation problem by enabling both known class classification and unknown class recognition through dual reprogramming strategies, eliminating the need for manual threshold specification.

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for
transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target
graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the
closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label
spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world
scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in
the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised
open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly
classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously
unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel
framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and
model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph
structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and
unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning
domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while
preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.
Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown
class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent
state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/cszhangzhen/GraphRTA.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic empirical study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles, evaluating 20 strategies across 14 benchmarks to understand how to create maximally diverse experts for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single GNN performance is limited by real-world graph heterogeneity, and recent Mixture-of-Experts frameworks show that assembling multiple diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly improve performance.

Method: Conducted comprehensive evaluation of 20 diversification strategies including random re-initialization, hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and training data partitioning across 14 node classification benchmarks, constructing and analyzing over 200 ensemble variants.

Result: The study examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and ensemble performance, and uncovers mechanistic insights into training maximally diverse experts.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable guidance for expert training and the design of effective Mixture-of-Experts frameworks on graph data.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on
relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the
heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple,
explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly
improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical
study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating
20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization,
hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and
training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we
construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation
examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and
ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training
maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for
expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data. Our

*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,ChangChun HUa,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision where training examples are n-tuples containing exactly m positives, but only the count m is observed. The authors develop a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) for this setting and prove its theoretical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address weakly supervised learning scenarios where only aggregate count information is available rather than instance-level labels, which occurs in applications like image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements.

Method: The method develops a closed-form unbiased risk estimator (URE) by linking tuple-generation processes to latent instance marginals. It extends to variable tuple sizes and counts, includes ReLU corrections for finite-sample stability, and provides theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity analysis.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, showing favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under class-prior imbalance and diverse tuple configurations.

Conclusion: Count-only supervision can be effectively exploited through a theoretically grounded and practically stable objective, demonstrating that aggregate count information alone is sufficient for effective learning in weakly supervised settings.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals
rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is
an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple
is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g.,
image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We
show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by
linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting
from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple
sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever
the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish
generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical
consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve
finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that
preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the
approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and
yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under
class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating
that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a
theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

*Christopher von Klitzing,Denis Blessing,Henrik Schopmans,Pascal Friederich,Gerhard Neumann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMT is a variational framework for Boltzmann generators that introduces constraints on KL divergence and entropy decay between sampling steps to improve distributional overlap and prevent mode collapse, achieving 2.5x higher effective sample size than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sampling from high-dimensional multimodal distributions like Boltzmann generators suffer from mode collapse (in variational approaches) or mass teleportation and heavy schedule tuning (in annealing-based methods).

Method: Constrained Mass Transport (CMT) generates intermediate distributions with constraints on both KL divergence and entropy decay between successive steps to enhance distributional overlap and mitigate premature convergence.

Result: CMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art variational methods across standard benchmarks and the ELIL tetrapeptide system, achieving more than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

Conclusion: The CMT framework provides an effective solution for sampling from high-dimensional multimodal distributions by addressing key limitations of existing methods through constrained intermediate distributions.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized
probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and
machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the
Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given
temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based
methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation
and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport
(CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under
constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive
steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass
teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG
benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system
studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more
than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SE-HTGNN is a novel heterogeneous temporal graph neural network that integrates temporal modeling into spatial learning via dynamic attention, achieving 10x speed-up while maintaining state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for heterogeneous temporal graphs rely on decoupled temporal and spatial learning, which weakens spatio-temporal interactions and leads to high model complexity.

Method: Proposes SE-HTGNN with dynamic attention mechanism that retains historical attention information to guide subsequent computation, and leverages large language models to capture implicit node type properties as prior knowledge.

Result: Achieves up to 10x speed-up over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SE-HTGNN provides a simple and efficient learning paradigm for heterogeneous temporal graphs that effectively integrates temporal and spatial learning through dynamic attention and LLM prompting.

Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the
real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous
attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes,
existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm,
which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high
model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for
HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network
(SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into
spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains
attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent
attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative
representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and
adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt
SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types
as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up
to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining
the best forecasting accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs often produce biased predictions with respect to sensitive attributes, but no prior studies have evaluated fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are crucial for applications like recommender systems.

Method: Generated new graphs from three knowledge graphs (YAGO, DBpedia, Wikidata) and benchmarked inprocessing and preprocessing methods across different GNN backbones and early stopping conditions.

Result: Knowledge graphs show clearer trade-offs between accuracy and fairness than other graphs; performance is significantly affected by GNN backbones and early stopping; preprocessing improves fairness while inprocessing improves accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides key insights for fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, emphasizing the need to consider backbone architectures and training conditions alongside fairness methods.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to
sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for
mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated
fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important
graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we
introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from
three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly
larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark
inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early
stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show
different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction
accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii)
the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but
also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing
methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve
prediction accuracy.

*Daniel Bethell,Simos Gerasimou,Radu Calinescu,Calum Imrie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC) to address the trade-off between safety and performance in reinforcement learning, achieving 40% fewer safety violations while maintaining competitive rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL safety methods either overly constrain performance or frequently violate safety constraints, creating diffuse cost landscapes that hinder policy improvement.

Method: USC integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into critic training, concentrating conservatism in uncertain/costly regions while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas.

Result: USC reduces safety violations by ~40%, maintains competitive/higher rewards, and reduces error between predicted and true cost gradients by ~83%.

Conclusion: USC breaks the prevailing safety-performance trade-off in RL, enabling scalable safe reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is
critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle
to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple
task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints
frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients
and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a
novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into
critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions
while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve
effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces
safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher
rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by
approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and
performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COPPOL is a conformal-driven perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation to produce calibrated hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections, enabling safer navigation in safety-critical environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation approaches assume perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception methods lack finite-sample guarantees, creating reliability gaps in safety-critical environments that require both accurate hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling.

Method: The approach integrates distribution-free, finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation to generate calibrated hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps then induce risk-aware cost fields for downstream reinforcement learning planning.

Result: COPPOL significantly increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to baselines, achieves near-complete detection of unsafe regions, reduces hazardous violations during navigation by up to approximately 50%, and remains robust to distributional shift while preserving both safety and efficiency.

Conclusion: COPPOL successfully bridges the gap between perception uncertainty and safety guarantees by providing calibrated hazard maps with rigorous finite-sample bounds, enabling more reliable navigation in safety-critical environments while maintaining robustness to distribution shifts.

Abstract: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate
hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream
safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume
perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception
approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven
perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free,
finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated
hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce
risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived
benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative
baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing
hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly,
our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and
efficiency.

### [85] [Pay Attention to the Triggers: Constructing Backdoors That Survive Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18541)
*Giovanni De Muri,Mark Vero,Robin Staab,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates security risks in knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher LLMs, showing that existing backdoors don't transfer well due to rare trigger tokens. The authors introduce T-MTB, a new backdooring technique using composite triggers from common tokens, enabling transferable backdoors that remain stealthy during distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address security risks in knowledge distillation where teacher models from untrusted parties may contain backdoors. Existing backdooring methods underestimate risks because their triggers rarely occur in normal contexts, preventing backdoor transfer to student models.

Method: The authors introduce T-MTB (Transferable Multi-Token Backdoor), which constructs composite triggers using several specific tokens that commonly occur individually in distillation datasets. This allows the poisoned teacher to remain stealthy while enabling backdoor transfer during distillation.

Result: T-MTB successfully demonstrates transferable backdoors across two attack scenarios (jailbreaking and content modulation) and four LLM model families. The method shows that carefully constructed triggers can transfer backdoors to student models, unlike prior approaches.

Conclusion: The study reveals underestimated security risks in knowledge distillation from potentially backdoored teacher models. T-MTB enables the study of transferable backdoors, highlighting the need for security considerations when using LLMs from untrusted sources for distillation.

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge
distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.
However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation
can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security
implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,
we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our
key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose
trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this
underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new
backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of
transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor
trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in
anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains
stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens
provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using
T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable
backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and
across four model families of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and sustainability.

Method: RAISE framework quantifies model performance across four dimensions and aggregates them into a single Responsibility Score. Evaluated three deep learning models (MLP, Tabular ResNet, Feature Tokenizer Transformer) on structured datasets from finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics.

Result: MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at high environmental cost, and Tabular ResNet offered balanced profile. No single model dominated across all responsibility criteria.

Conclusion: Highlights necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for responsible model selection, with trade-offs between different responsibility criteria.

dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We
evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular
ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from
finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical
trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the
Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high
environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These
results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility
criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for
responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at:

*Yusi Fan,Tian Wang,Zhiying Yan,Chang Liu,Qiong Zhou,Qi Lu,Zhehao Guo,Ziqi Deng,Wenyu Zhu,Ruochi Zhang,Fengfeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HeFS is a genetic algorithm-based framework that enhances existing feature selection methods by identifying complementary Helper Sets from residual features, improving classification performance through multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional feature selection methods often suffer from premature convergence and miss subtle informative features, especially in high-dimensional datasets with complex feature relationships.

Method: Uses biased initialization and ratio-guided mutation in a genetic algorithm with Pareto-based multi-objective optimization to maximize both predictive accuracy and feature complementarity.

Result: Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets show HeFS consistently identifies overlooked informative features and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across various domains.

Conclusion: HeFS effectively refines feature subsets by systematically searching residual feature space for complementary Helper Sets, demonstrating improved classification performance in challenging applications.

Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard.
Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are
prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative
features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional
datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We
introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine
feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches
the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement
the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach
employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism
within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective
optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature
complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS
consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging
domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and
computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at

*Chia-Hsuan Lu,Tony Tan,Michael Benedikt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents RobLight, a method that improves structural robustness verification for graph neural networks by using efficient partial solvers instead of powerful constraint solvers, achieving better performance while maintaining effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for adversarial robustness verification in GNNs rely on powerful constraint solvers like mixed integer programming, which can be computationally expensive. The authors aim to develop a more efficient approach using polynomial-time partial solvers.

Method: The proposed RobLight tool replaces the use of powerful complete solvers with calls to efficient partial solvers that run in polynomial time but may be incomplete, focusing on structural robustness verification for graph neural networks.

Result: RobLight improves on the state of the art in structural robustness verification, as evaluated on diverse GNN variants and datasets, demonstrating better performance compared to existing constraint-solving approaches.

Conclusion: Using efficient partial solvers instead of powerful complete solvers can effectively improve structural robustness verification for graph neural networks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning
over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the
detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with
a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial
robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were
originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many
other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack
model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or
instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art
techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on
top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is
possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by
replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers,
which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool
RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.

*Fayad Ali Banna,Antoine Caradot,Eduardo Brandao,Jean-Philippe Colombier,Rémi Emonet,Marc Sebban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unrolled-SINDy improves PDE discovery from sparse time-sampled data by decoupling numerical time step size from data sampling rate, enabling recovery of equation parameters that standard SINDy methods miss due to large truncation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SINDy approaches fail when data is sparsely sampled in time, limiting their applicability to real-world problems with irregular temporal observations.

Method: Leverages an unrolling scheme to improve stability of explicit methods for PDE discovery, allowing decorrelation between numerical time step size and data sampling rate. Can be implemented via iterative closed-form approach or gradient descent scheme.

Result: The method enables recovery of equation parameters inaccessible to non-unrolled methods, working effectively with both traditional SINDy and noise-robust iNeuralSINDy using different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4).

Conclusion: Unrolled-SINDy provides a versatile approach that extends PDE discovery capabilities to sparsely sampled temporal data scenarios where previous methods failed.

Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a
physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches
based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to
address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled
in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology
that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods
for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the
sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of
equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy
optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be
exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient
descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both
traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with
different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows
to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

TL;DR: A new method for distilling boosted trees into decision trees to balance predictive performance and interpretability using rectification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create machine learning models that offer a good compromise between predictive performance and interpretability by distilling complex boosted trees into simpler decision trees.

Method: Using a correction approach called rectification to implement the distillation process from boosted trees to decision trees.

Result: Empirical results show that this rectification-based approach provides interesting results compared to distillation achieved by retraining the model.

Conclusion: The rectification approach for distilling boosted trees into decision trees offers a promising method for achieving interpretable models while maintaining reasonable predictive performance.

Abstract: We present a new approach for distilling boosted trees into decision trees,
in the objective of generating an ML model offering an acceptable compromise in
terms of predictive performance and interpretability. We explain how the
correction approach called rectification can be used to implement such a

interesting results, in comparison with an approach to distillation achieved by
retraining the model.

*Satwik Bhattamishra,Phil Blunsom,Varun Kanade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP) setting, which provides richer labels than conventional classification but still makes learning DFAs and Boolean formulas computationally hard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the NSP setting for PAC-learning analysis and understand whether the richer label information makes learning easier, particularly for practical applications like analyzing neural sequence models and learning language model support.

Method: The authors formalize the NSP setting and construct a reduction from conventional learning problems to learning with NSP labels, making most additional labels uninformative.

Result: Learning concept classes like DFAs and Boolean formulas remains computationally hard in the NSP setting, even with the richer label information provided.

Conclusion: Despite providing more informative labels than conventional classification, the NSP setting does not make learning DFAs and Boolean formulas computationally easier, as these problems remain hard under cryptographic assumptions.

Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP)
setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language
together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the
language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This
setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence
models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP
setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We
formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While
the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional
classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and
Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction
that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction
from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under
cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning
DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

*Miro Miranda,Marcela Charfuelan,Matias Valdenegro Toro,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a physics-informed machine learning approach that combines crop simulation models with ML to predict crop yield as a function of water scarcity, achieving better accuracy than traditional models while maintaining explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crop simulation models are explainable but perform poorly, while machine learning models are powerful but lack physical principles. The study aims to bridge this gap by coupling both advantages.

Method: Formulate crop yield as a function of temporal water scarcity, predict crop drought stress and sensitivity to water scarcity, use physics-informed loss function, leverage multispectral satellite imagery, meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data, and employ deep ensemble approach for uncertainty.

Result: The method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers with a coefficient of determination (R²-score) of up to 0.82 while offering high explainability.

Conclusion: This approach provides accurate crop yield prediction with physical consistency and explainability, offering decision support for building resilient agriculture in changing climate conditions.

Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages
and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for
ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,
which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often
perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are
powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack
adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this
gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield
is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop
yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop
drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.
Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield
prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss
function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,
meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the
uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our
method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop
yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to
0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support
for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient
agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

*Madeline Navarro,Lisa O'Bryan,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking in group conversations using individual characteristics and past speaking behavior, with generalization across different groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversation models lack generalization beyond single groups and use universal formulations that may not suit all groups, limiting insights into turn-taking patterns.

Method: Developed a generalization of prior conversation models that predicts speaking turns based on individual personality traits and prior speaking behavior, with novel ability to learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke.

Result: Applied the model to synthetic and real-world conversation data, demonstrating that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic.

Conclusion: The proposed data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach provides better characterization of real group interactions and motivates moving beyond unrealistic behavioral models.

Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns
in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past
speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights
that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to
characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be
suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation
models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on
their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior
speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to
learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We
apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the
proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results
demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic,
motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are largely preventable with early detection, and body-worn sensors enable continuous monitoring while preserving patient comfort. However, sensor data analysis must be robust, reliable, efficient, and accurate. Deep learning can automate interpretation and reduce clinician workload.

Method: The authors propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) data to solve a binary classification problem. The model is trained and validated on the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.

Result: The approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive accuracy. Energy consumption analysis on microcontrollers and experimental sensor devices confirms that on-device inference is more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates feasibility for applying deep learning to cardiovascular monitoring on resource-constrained medical edge devices, offering significant efficiency improvements while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early
signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn
sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the

clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a

TL;DR: This paper conducts the first comprehensive study of reasoning large language model (RLLM) serving performance, revealing distinct serving behaviors and evaluating existing inference optimization techniques for RLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The serving performance and behavior of reasoning large language models (RLLMs) remain unexplored, which may undermine their real-world deployment despite their competitive performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors perform a pilot study comparing RLLM and traditional LLM serving performance, investigate the effectiveness of existing inference optimization techniques (model quantization, speculative decoding, prefix caching, KV cache quantization), and conduct evaluation under real-world workload modeled by Gamma distribution.

Result: Key findings include: (1) RLLMs show significant memory usage fluctuations, straggler requests, adaptive running time, and domain preference; (2) Model quantization and speculative decoding improve efficiency with small accuracy compromise; (3) Prefix caching and KV cache quantization may degrade accuracy or performance for small RLLMs; (4) Real-world workload evaluations confirm these findings.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for advancing RLLM inference serving, highlighting that while some optimization techniques work well, others may be detrimental, emphasizing the need for specialized serving strategies for reasoning models.

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in
solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to
general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains
unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in
real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on
comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal
that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)
significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive
running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether
existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main
takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can
improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while
prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving
performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world
workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical
results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned
with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the
research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference
serving.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task-agnostic multi-teacher distillation framework using a "majority vote" objective function that leverages teacher diversity to create enriched representations without task-specific labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-teacher distillation methods are often task-specific and don't fully leverage the diversity of different embedding models (varying architectures, loss functions, modalities, datasets) that capture unique aspects of inputs.

Method: A task-agnostic framework based on a "majority vote" objective function that is bounded by mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings, eliminating dependence on task-specific labels or prior knowledge.

Result: Evaluations across text, vision models, and molecular modeling show the method effectively leverages teacher diversity, resulting in representations that enable better performance for downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and regression. State-of-the-art embedding models were trained and released.

Conclusion: The proposed task-agnostic distillation framework successfully leverages diverse teacher embeddings to create enriched representations that improve performance across various downstream tasks in multiple modalities.

Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step
across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in
architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing
unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this
diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a
``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is
bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,
leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on
task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision
models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages
teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for
a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or
regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding
models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for reinforcement learning with multi-step predictions, addressing challenges of high dimensionality and imperfect predictions through Bayesian value functions and a novel Bellman-Jensen Gap analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL assumes Markov decision processes with one-step transitions, but many real-world applications (energy management, stock investment) provide multi-step predictions that offer decision-making advantages but create exponential state space growth and theoretical analysis challenges.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Bayesian value function for tractable prediction-aware policies, 2) Bellman-Jensen Gap analysis to characterize imperfect predictions, 3) BOLA algorithm - a two-stage model-based RL approach separating offline Bayesian value learning from online adaptation to real-time predictions.

Result: The authors prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect predictions, and validate their approach on synthetic MDPs and a real-world wind energy storage control problem.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenges of multi-step predictions in RL, providing theoretical guarantees and practical algorithms that maintain efficiency despite prediction imperfections, with demonstrated applicability to real-world problems.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions
based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In
many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,
agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide
additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are
inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP
leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.
Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented
MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot
accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We
address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the
\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware
policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis
on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of
imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with
Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline
Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time
predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect
predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a
real-world wind energy storage control problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniCast is a unified probabilistic weather forecasting model that combines a VAE encoder with a diffusion-based transformer to forecast across multiple timescales, achieving competitive medium-range performance and state-of-the-art subseasonal-to-seasonal results while being significantly faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven weather forecasting methods struggle with longer subseasonal-to-seasonal horizons due to error accumulation in autoregressive approaches, creating a need for models that can unify forecasting across timescales without compounding errors.

Method: OmniCast uses a VAE to encode weather data into a lower-dimensional latent space, then employs a diffusion-based transformer that generates future latent tokens through iterative unmasking during training and inference, enabling joint sampling across space and time.

Result: OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic methods at medium-range (10-20x faster) and achieves state-of-the-art performance at subseasonal-to-seasonal scales across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics, with stable rollouts up to 100 years.

Conclusion: The proposed unified probabilistic model successfully addresses error accumulation in long-term weather forecasting through latent space modeling and diffusion-based generation, enabling scalable and skillful forecasting across multiple timescales.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but
struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error
accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose
OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather
forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model
that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent
space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of
future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we
mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their
distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion
head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future
tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling
across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic
methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale
across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead.

TL;DR: STEAM is a novel method for generating synthetic medical data specifically designed for treatment effect analysis, addressing the unique challenges of causal inference tasks by preserving covariate distributions, treatment assignment mechanisms, and outcome generation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical datasets are difficult to access due to regulatory barriers, making synthetic data valuable for medical analyses and development of causal inference methods. Existing generative models don't address the specific challenges of downstream causal inference tasks focused on treatments.

Method: Proposed STEAM (Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine) that mimics the data-generating process of treatment data and optimizes for three key desiderata: preservation of covariate distribution, treatment assignment mechanism, and outcome generation mechanism.

Result: STEAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across evaluation metrics compared to existing generative models, particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

Conclusion: STEAM provides an effective solution for generating synthetic medical data specifically tailored for treatment effect analysis, outperforming existing methods in preserving the essential components needed for accurate causal inference.

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical
interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access
due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable
asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new
inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that
closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not
consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and
specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of
desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise
downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the
treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.
Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess
such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating
Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the
data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our
desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,
particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAGE is a new QAT method that uses curvature-aware gradient correction to reduce the accuracy gap between quantization-aware training and native training, achieving significant improvements in W4A4 quantization for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is still a large accuracy gap between low-bit quantization-aware training techniques and native training, which needs to be addressed to make quantization more practical for large models.

Method: CAGE augments the straight-through estimator gradient with a curvature-aware correction derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances loss minimization with quantization constraints, using local curvature information.

Result: CAGE recovers over 10% of the quantization-induced loss increase in W4A4 regime for Llama-style models up to 800M parameters, outperforming outlier-mitigation methods.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware gradient corrections can bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods in quantization-aware training.

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there
is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To
address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new
QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a
curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by
quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances
loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a
principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the
theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for
quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence
guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our
approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient
implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style
models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the
quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation
methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can
bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SB-SETM is an online topic model that extends the Embedded Topic Model to handle data streams by merging models from successive document batches, using truncated stick-breaking for topic inference and optimal transport for topic embedding merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online topic models are needed for real-world data streams that evolve over time, but they receive less attention than offline models due to additional challenges in handling continuous data.

Method: SB-SETM extends ETM by: (i) using truncated stick-breaking construction for topic-per-document distribution to infer active topics automatically, and (ii) introducing a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on continuous optimal transport in high-dimensional latent space.

Result: Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforms baselines on simulated scenarios and performs well on a real-world corpus of news articles about the Russian-Ukrainian war from 2022-2023.

Conclusion: SB-SETM successfully addresses challenges in online topic modeling by providing an effective framework for processing evolving data streams with automatic topic inference and robust merging strategies.

Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in
data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods
naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less
attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to
specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an
innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data
streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To
this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the
topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from
the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)
introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous
formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the
latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines
on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news
articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

### [102] [On Biologically Plausible Learning in Continuous Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18808)
*Marc Gong Bacvanski,Liu Ziyin,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A continuous-time neural model that unifies biologically plausible learning algorithms without phase separation, showing that learning depends on temporal overlap between inputs and error signals, with robust learning requiring plasticity timescales 1-2 orders of magnitude longer than stimulus duration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a continuous-time neural model that unifies biologically plausible learning algorithms and removes the need for separate inference and learning phases, addressing the gap between biological learning that unfolds continuously and most algorithmic models that rely on discrete updates.

Method: Developed a continuous-time neural model that naturally emerges various learning rules (SGD, FA, DFA, KP) as limiting cases. Used simulations to test learning at biological timescales under temporal mismatches and integration noise, and analyzed learning dependence on temporal overlap between inputs and error signals.

Result: Continuous-time networks stably learn at biological timescales. Learning depends on temporal overlap - synapses update correctly only when input and error signals coincide in time. Learning strength declines linearly with delay between input and error. Robust learning requires plasticity timescales 1-2 orders of magnitude longer than stimulus duration.

Conclusion: For typical cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), functional plasticity windows must be in the few-second range, identifying seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in biological circuits.

Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models
rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a
continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible
learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback
alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of
the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn
at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.
Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal
overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding
error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength
declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus
duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.
Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to
exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical
cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity
window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies
seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in
biological circuits.

### [103] [When LRP Diverges from Leave-One-Out in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18810)
*Weiqiu You,Siqi Zeng,Yao-Hung Hubert Tsai,Makoto Yamada,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) in Transformers, finding that bilinear propagation rules violate implementation invariance and that bypassing softmax layers improves alignment with Leave-One-Out (LOO) feature importance measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRP offers computational efficiency over LOO for feature importance analysis, but its theoretical soundness in modern Transformers hasn't been thoroughly examined. The authors aim to identify issues with current LRP implementations and improve alignment with LOO.

Method: The study analytically proves and empirically confirms that bilinear propagation rules in AttnLRP violate implementation invariance. They also test CP-LRP as a baseline and experiment with bypassing relevance propagation through softmax layers, instead backpropagating only through value matrices.

Result: Bilinear propagation rules were shown to violate implementation invariance in linear attention layers. Bypassing softmax propagation significantly improved LRP's alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late Transformer layers.

Conclusion: Two main factors undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers: (i) bilinear factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error. The findings suggest specific architectural modifications could improve LRP's reliability for feature importance analysis.

Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but
is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern
Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that
the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the
implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it
empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a
diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the
softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices --
significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late
Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear
factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially
jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

*Jesús García Fernández,Nasir Ahmad,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This review provides a unified perspective on iterative optimization in AI, bridging gradient-based methods with derivative-free approaches and connecting them to neural network training and biological learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework for understanding optimization methods across machine learning and biological systems, particularly highlighting how derivative-free methods can bridge the gap between artificial and natural intelligence.

Method: Categorizes optimization approaches by derivative order, explores adaptation to neural network training challenges, and applies these insights to biological learning through a zeroth-order optimization lens.

Result: Demonstrates that modern zeroth-order methods can effectively approximate gradients and achieve competitive performance with backpropagation in neural networks, while also providing a principled mathematical framework for understanding biological learning.

Conclusion: The zeroth-order optimization paradigm offers a powerful framework that not only advances our understanding of biological learning by leveraging intrinsic noise as a computational resource, but also has significant implications for developing energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware systems.

Abstract: Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and
provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review
provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with
neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based
methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation
(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder
scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or
zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that
rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample
efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can
effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP
in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for
biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and
feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological
learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain
learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based
on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,
second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how
these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training
and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to
view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO
paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.
This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence
but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design
fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.

*Mengqi Li,Lei Zhao,Anthony Man-Cho So,Ruoyu Sun,Xiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online Supervised Finetuning (OSFT) is a simple, reward-free method where LLMs generate their own responses and are immediately finetuned on this self-generated data, achieving performance comparable to complex reinforcement learning methods on mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient alternative to complex, reward-based training paradigms like reinforcement learning, which often require extensive rollouts and reward engineering.

Method: A self-help online supervised finetuning paradigm where the model generates responses and is immediately finetuned on its own self-generated data using just one rollout by default.

Result: OSFT achieves downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO, while being more efficient and robust.

Conclusion: OSFT offers an efficient and promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms by facilitating the model's existing latent knowledge from pretraining, leading to improved reasoning ability.

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm
for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and
is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly
efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses
just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves
downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable
to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as
GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of
OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing
preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to
reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and
promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our

### [106] [Search Self-play: Pushing the Frontier of Agent Capability without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18821)
*Hongliang Lu,Yuhang Wen,Pengyu Cheng,Ruijin Ding,Haotian Xu,Jiaqi Guo,Chutian Wang,Haonan Chen,Xiaoxi Jiang,Guanjun Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Search Self-Play (SSP), a method for training LLM agents through self-play where the model acts as both task proposer and problem solver, eliminating the need for human-crafted queries and ground-truth answers in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RLVR requires massive human effort for crafting task queries and ground-truth answers, hindering scalability in agentic scenarios. Existing task synthesis methods struggle to control task difficulty effectively for RL training.

Method: SSP uses self-play training where the LLM acts as both task proposer (generating deep search queries with increasing difficulty) and problem solver (answering queries). It ensures query validity through retrieval-augmented generation using search results from the proposer's trajectory.

Result: SSP significantly improves search agents' performance uniformly across various benchmarks without supervision, working effectively in both from-scratch and continuous RL training setups.

Conclusion: SSP enables scalable agentic RLVR training by eliminating human supervision requirements through self-play co-evolution of task proposer and problem solver capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the
mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on
well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide
accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL
scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent
works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks
can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To
achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for
deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine
calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.
The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined
ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries
to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer
predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground
truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as
external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to
test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary
search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer
and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and
cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can
significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various
benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL
training setups. The code is at https://github.com/Alibaba-Quark/SSP.

TL;DR: BO4Mob is a benchmark framework for high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization focused on origin-destination travel demand estimation in large urban road networks, featuring five real-world scenarios with dimensions up to 10,100.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of estimating OD travel demand from limited traffic sensor data in large-scale transportation networks, which is a difficult inverse optimization problem with computationally expensive, stochastic, and non-differentiable objective evaluations.

Method: BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San Jose road networks using high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations with realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics.

Conclusion: BO4Mob serves as a valuable benchmark for developing scalable optimization algorithms and their application in data-driven urban mobility models, including high-resolution digital twins of metropolitan road networks.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional
Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD)
travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel
demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization
problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This
problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each
objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and
non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San
Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These
scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that
incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the
benchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three
state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is
designed to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms
and their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models,
including high-resolution digital twins of metropolitan road networks. Code and

### [108] [Actor-Free Continuous Control via Structurally Maximizable Q-Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18828)
*Yigit Korkmaz,Urvi Bhuwania,Ayush Jain,Erdem Bıyık*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A purely value-based framework for continuous control that uses structural maximization of Q-functions instead of actor-critic methods, achieving comparable performance without learning a separate actor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Value-based algorithms are stable but traditionally limited to discrete action spaces. Actor-critic methods for continuous spaces suffer from training instability despite their popularity.

Method: Proposes an actor-free Q-learning approach with structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing key architectural and algorithmic choices for efficient learning in continuous action spaces.

Result: Achieves performance and sample efficiency on par with state-of-the-art baselines on standard simulation tasks. Particularly outperforms traditional methods in constrained action spaces where value functions are non-smooth.

Conclusion: The proposed value-based framework provides a stable and efficient alternative to actor-critic methods for continuous control, especially effective in constrained action environments.

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A counterfactual inference framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis, applied to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 in heart failure patients, combining predictive modeling with counterfactual search to identify actionable pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge causal reasoning and predictive modeling for personalized healthcare, specifically addressing the need for interpretable, patient-specific interventions to prevent PASC-related hospital admissions in heart failure patients.

Method: Integration of regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search using exact enumeration and optimization-based methods (NICE and MOC algorithms) to explore high-dimensional intervention spaces in longitudinal healthcare data.

Result: Strong discriminative performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) on 2700+ individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, generating interpretable patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity patterns or treatment factors could alter outcomes.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization problem over predictive functions, providing a rigorous, interpretable, and computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex biomedical systems.

Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning
about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal
reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference
framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,
illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal
diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,
we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to
identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The
framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including
the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective
Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional
intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative
performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,
patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity
patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work
demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization
problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and
computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex
biomedical systems.

*Howard Chen,Noam Razin,Karthik Narasimhan,Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper systematically compares forgetting patterns in language models between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), finding RL leads to less catastrophic forgetting while achieving comparable or better target task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate catastrophic forgetting in language models during post-training adaptation, specifically comparing different post-training methods to identify guidelines for reducing knowledge degradation.

Method: Systematic comparison of SFT and RL across different LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, arithmetic reasoning), using a simplified mixture model analysis to investigate the underlying causes of forgetting differences.

Result: RL consistently leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving comparable or higher target task performance. The mode-seeking nature of RL, enabled by on-policy data, is identified as the key factor for preserving prior knowledge.

Conclusion: RL's use of on-policy data underlies its robustness to forgetting, and approximately on-policy data can be an efficient alternative for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in practical applications.

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses tensor factorization problems with substantial missing data, particularly relevant for recommendation systems in social networks where only sparse measurements of tensor components are available.

Method: The authors use statistical inference in a high-dimensional dense limit, develop message-passing algorithms, and employ replica theory that becomes exact in the dense limit. They test their approach in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting.

Result: The paper presents theoretical insights and algorithmic solutions for tensor factorization with sparse measurements, with the replica theory providing exact performance analysis in the dense limit.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides effective methods for tensor factorization in scenarios with missing data, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical algorithms suitable for applications like recommendation systems.

Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the tensor
components. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of
interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a
substantial amount of data is missing, as in recommendation systems heavily
used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the
setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high
dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and
dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test
them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting. We also develop a replica
theory, which becomes exact in the dense limit,to examine the performance of
statistical inference.

*Chuansen Peng,Xiaojing Shen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A unified framework for jointly inferring time-varying network topologies and imputing missing data from partially observed graph signals using non-convex optimization with fused-lasso regularization and ADMM solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem of simultaneously recovering time-varying network structures and missing data from partial graph observations, overcoming limitations of conventional decoupled methods.

Method: Proposed non-convex optimization with fused-lasso regularization on graph Laplacians for temporal smoothness, solved via efficient ADMM algorithm with closed-form solutions for both graph and signal subproblems.

Result: The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in convergence speed and joint accuracy, with proven convergence guarantees and non-asymptotic statistical error bounds.

Conclusion: The integrated approach enables bidirectional information flow between graph and signal domains, providing superior robustness in high missing-data regimes while capturing realistic network dynamics through temporal smoothness constraints.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of jointly inferring time-varying
network topologies and imputing missing data from partially observed graph
signals. We propose a unified non-convex optimization framework to
simultaneously recover a sequence of graph Laplacian matrices while
reconstructing the unobserved signal entries. Unlike conventional decoupled
methods, our integrated approach facilitates a bidirectional flow of
information between the graph and signal domains, yielding superior robustness,
particularly in high missing-data regimes. To capture realistic network
dynamics, we introduce a fused-lasso type regularizer on the sequence of
Laplacians. This penalty promotes temporal smoothness by penalizing large
successive changes, thereby preventing spurious variations induced by noise
while still permitting gradual topological evolution. For solving the joint
optimization problem, we develop an efficient Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which leverages the problem's structure to yield
closed-form solutions for both the graph and signal subproblems. This design
ensures scalability to large-scale networks and long time horizons. On the
theoretical front, despite the inherent non-convexity, we establish a
convergence guarantee, proving that the proposed ADMM scheme converges to a
stationary point. Furthermore, we derive non-asymptotic statistical guarantees,
providing high-probability error bounds for the graph estimator as a function
of sample size, signal smoothness, and the intrinsic temporal variability of
the graph. Extensive numerical experiments validate the approach, demonstrating
that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and the joint accuracy of graph learning and signal recovery.

TL;DR: This paper introduces arbitrated indirect treatment comparisons to resolve the MAIC paradox, where different sponsors analyzing the same data reach conflicting conclusions about treatment effectiveness by targeting different populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the MAIC paradox identified by Jiang et al. (2025), where inconsistent conclusions arise from different sponsors analyzing the same data due to targeting different populations in matching-adjusted indirect comparisons.

Method: Proposes a new class of methods called arbitrated indirect treatment comparisons that focus on estimating treatment effects in a common target population, specifically the overlap population.

Result: The methods aim to resolve inconsistencies in MAIC analyses by establishing a unified approach that targets the same population across different analyses.

Conclusion: Arbitrated indirect treatment comparisons provide a solution to the MAIC paradox by focusing on a common target population (overlap population), enabling consistent treatment effect comparisons across different analyses.

Abstract: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) has been increasingly employed
in health technology assessments (HTA). By reweighting subjects from a trial
with individual participant data (IPD) to match the covariate summary
statistics of another trial with only aggregate data (AgD), MAIC facilitates
the estimation of a treatment effect defined with respect to the AgD trial
population. This manuscript introduces a new class of methods, termed
arbitrated indirect treatment comparisons, designed to address the ``MAIC
paradox'' -- a phenomenon highlighted by Jiang et al.~(2025). The MAIC paradox
arises when different sponsors, analyzing the same data, reach conflicting
conclusions regarding which treatment is more effective. The underlying issue
is that each sponsor implicitly targets a different population. To resolve this
inconsistency, the proposed methods focus on estimating treatment effects in a
common target population, specifically chosen to be the overlap population.

*Tongtong Liang,Alexander Cloninger,Rahul Parhi,Yu-Xiang Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis showing how data geometry controls implicit bias in overparameterized two-layer ReLU networks, with generalization bounds that adapt to intrinsic dimension and deteriorate as data concentrates toward the unit sphere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how data geometry, neural architecture, and training dynamics interact to control generalization in overparameterized neural networks, particularly focusing on the implicit bias of gradient descent.

Method: Theoretical analysis of overparameterized two-layer ReLU networks trained below the edge of stability, examining data distributions supported on mixtures of low-dimensional balls and isotropic distributions with varying concentration toward the unit sphere.

Result: Derived generalization bounds that adapt to intrinsic dimension for low-dimensional ball distributions, and showed that generalization rates deteriorate as probability mass concentrates toward the sphere for isotropic distributions.

Conclusion: Data that is harder to "shatter" with respect to ReLU activation thresholds leads gradient descent to learn shared patterns and generalize well, while easily shattered data (like sphere-supported data) favors memorization.

Abstract: Understanding generalization in overparameterized neural networks hinges on
the interplay between the data geometry, neural architecture, and training
dynamics. In this paper, we theoretically explore how data geometry controls
this implicit bias. This paper presents theoretical results for
overparameterized two-layer ReLU networks trained below the edge of stability.
First, for data distributions supported on a mixture of low-dimensional balls,
we derive generalization bounds that provably adapt to the intrinsic dimension.
Second, for a family of isotropic distributions that vary in how strongly
probability mass concentrates toward the unit sphere, we derive a spectrum of
bounds showing that rates deteriorate as the mass concentrates toward the
sphere. These results instantiate a unifying principle: When the data is harder
to "shatter" with respect to the activation thresholds of the ReLU neurons,
gradient descent tends to learn representations that capture shared patterns
and thus finds solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, for data that
is easily shattered (e.g., data supported on the sphere) gradient descent
favors memorization. Our theoretical results consolidate disparate empirical
findings that have appeared in the literature.

### [115] [Beating the Winner's Curse via Inference-Aware Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18161)
*Hamsa Bastani,Osbert Bastani,Bryce McLaughlin*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'inference-aware policy optimization' to address the winner's curse in treatment policy learning by optimizing both estimated outcomes and statistical significance of improvement over existing policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the winner's curse problem where policy optimization exploits prediction errors rather than finding genuine improvements, leading to unreliable performance claims in downstream policy evaluation.

Method: Develop inference-aware policy optimization that considers both estimated objective value and statistical significance of improvement over observational policy. Characterize Pareto frontier for tradeoff between these goals and design algorithm using ML predictions to estimate this frontier.

Result: The methodology enables decision-makers to select policies optimizing their desired tradeoff between performance and statistical confidence, with simulations demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: Inference-aware policy optimization provides a principled approach to address winner's curse in treatment policy learning, allowing reliable policy selection with statistical confidence guarantees.

Abstract: There has been a surge of recent interest in automatically learning policies
to target treatment decisions based on rich individual covariates. A common
approach is to train a machine learning model to predict counterfactual
outcomes, and then select the policy that optimizes the predicted objective
value. In addition, practitioners also want confidence that the learned policy
has better performance than the incumbent policy according to downstream policy
evaluation. However, due to the winner's curse-an issue where the policy
optimization procedure exploits prediction errors rather than finding actual
improvements-predicted performance improvements are often not substantiated by
downstream policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
strategy called inference-aware policy optimization, which modifies policy
optimization to account for how the policy will be evaluated downstream.
Specifically, it optimizes not only for the estimated objective value, but also
for the chances that the policy will be statistically significantly better than
the observational policy used to collect data. We mathematically characterize
the Pareto frontier of policies according to the tradeoff of these two goals.
Based on our characterization, we design a policy optimization algorithm that
uses machine learning to predict counterfactual outcomes, and then plugs in
these predictions to estimate the Pareto frontier; then, the decision-maker can
select the policy that optimizes their desired tradeoff, after which policy
evaluation can be performed on the test set as usual. Finally, we perform
simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology.

### [116] [The Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Data-Driven Optimization: A Local Misspecification Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18215)
*Haixiang Lan,Luofeng Liao,Adam N. Elmachtoub,Christian Kroer,Henry Lam,Haofeng Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the relative performance of data-driven stochastic optimization methods (SAA, ETO, IEO) under local misspecification, showing a bias-variance tradeoff that depends on the degree of model misspecification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current understanding of stochastic optimization methods is limited to dichotomous cases of well-specified or misspecified models, lacking granular analysis for nearly well-specified scenarios.

Method: The authors develop a framework using contiguity theory from statistics to analyze local misspecification, deriving explicit expressions for decision bias and characterizing misspecification directions.

Result: The study reveals a bias-variance tradeoff between SAA, IEO, and ETO methods under local misspecification, with relative importance of bias and variance depending on the degree of misspecification.

Conclusion: The analysis provides geometric understanding of variance and characterizes impactful vs unimpactful misspecification directions, offering more nuanced insights into method selection for stochastic optimization problems.

Abstract: Data-driven stochastic optimization is ubiquitous in machine learning and
operational decision-making problems. Sample average approximation (SAA) and
model-based approaches such as estimate-then-optimize (ETO) or integrated
estimation-optimization (IEO) are all popular, with model-based approaches
being able to circumvent some of the issues with SAA in complex
context-dependent problems. Yet the relative performance of these methods is
poorly understood, with most results confined to the dichotomous cases of the
model-based approach being either well-specified or misspecified. We develop
the first results that allow for a more granular analysis of the relative
performance of these methods under a local misspecification setting, which
models the scenario where the model-based approach is nearly well-specified. By
leveraging tools from contiguity theory in statistics, we show that there is a
bias-variance tradeoff between SAA, IEO, and ETO under local misspecification,
and that the relative importance of the bias and the variance depends on the
degree of local misspecification. Moreover, we derive explicit expressions for
the decision bias, which allows us to characterize (un)impactful
misspecification directions, and provide further geometric understanding of the
variance.

### [117] [Learning under Quantization for High-Dimensional Linear Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18259)
*Dechen Zhang,Junwei Su,Difan Zou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: First systematic theoretical study of low-bit quantization's impact on learning performance, analyzing SGD for high-dimensional linear regression across data, labels, parameters, activations, and gradient quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread empirical success of low-bit quantization for efficient large-scale model training, rigorous theoretical understanding of its impact on learning performance remains notably absent, even in simple linear regression settings.

Method: Novel analytical framework establishing precise algorithm-dependent and data-dependent excess risk bounds for finite-step SGD in high-dimensional linear regression, analyzing comprehensive range of quantization targets: data, labels, parameters, activations, and gradients.

Result: Different quantization types have distinct effects: parameter, activation, and gradient quantization amplify noise during training; data quantization distorts data spectrum; data and label quantization introduce additional approximation and quantized error. Multiplicative quantization eliminates spectral distortion, while additive quantization shows beneficial scaling effect with batch size.

Conclusion: The theory provides powerful lens to characterize how quantization shapes learning dynamics of optimization algorithms, paving way to explore learning theory under practical hardware constraints, with quantitative comparisons between multiplicative and additive quantization drawing parallels to FP vs integer quantization methods.

Abstract: The use of low-bit quantization has emerged as an indispensable technique for
enabling the efficient training of large-scale models. Despite its widespread
empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its impact on
learning performance remains notably absent, even in the simplest linear
regression setting. We present the first systematic theoretical study of this
fundamental question, analyzing finite-step stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
for high-dimensional linear regression under a comprehensive range of
quantization targets: data, labels, parameters, activations, and gradients. Our
novel analytical framework establishes precise algorithm-dependent and
data-dependent excess risk bounds that characterize how different quantization
affects learning: parameter, activation, and gradient quantization amplify
noise during training; data quantization distorts the data spectrum; and data
and label quantization introduce additional approximation and quantized error.
Crucially, we prove that for multiplicative quantization (with input-dependent
quantization step), this spectral distortion can be eliminated, and for
additive quantization (with constant quantization step), a beneficial scaling
effect with batch size emerges. Furthermore, for common polynomial-decay data
spectra, we quantitatively compare the risks of multiplicative and additive
quantization, drawing a parallel to the comparison between FP and integer
quantization methods. Our theory provides a powerful lens to characterize how
quantization shapes the learning dynamics of optimization algorithms, paving
the way to further explore learning theory under practical hardware
constraints.

### [118] [Parametrising the Inhomogeneity Inducing Capacity of a Training Set, and its Impact on Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18332)
*Gargi Roy,Dalia Chakrabarty*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces an 'inhomogeneity parameter' that measures when training data requires non-stationary models, proves that non-zero inhomogeneity necessitates non-stationary Gaussian Processes, and shows this affects prediction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and parameterize when training datasets require inhomogeneous correlation structures in learned models, distinguishing this from conventional non-stationarity.

Method: Define an inhomogeneity parameter computable for datasets, prove its necessity for non-stationary Gaussian Processes, and validate on real-world multivariate functions.

Result: Demonstrated computation on public datasets, showed conventional non-stationarity doesn't imply non-zero inhomogeneity, and proved non-zero inhomogeneity requires non-stationary models affecting prediction reliability.

Conclusion: The inhomogeneity parameter is crucial for determining when non-stationary models are necessary, directly impacting prediction quality and reliability in Gaussian Process learning.

Abstract: We introduce parametrisation of that property of the available
  training dataset, that necessitates an inhomogeneous correlation
  structure for the function that is learnt as a model of the
  relationship between the pair of variables, observations of which
  comprise the considered training data. We refer to a parametrisation
  of this property of a given training set, as its ``inhomogeneity
  parameter''. It is easy to compute this parameter for small-to-large
  datasets, and we demonstrate such computation on multiple
  publicly-available datasets, while also demonstrating that
  conventional ``non-stationarity'' of data does not imply a non-zero
  inhomogeneity parameter of the dataset. We prove that - within the
  probabilistic Gaussian Process-based learning approach - a training
  set with a non-zero inhomogeneity parameter renders it imperative,
  that the process that is invoked to model the sought function, be
  non-stationary. Following the learning of a real-world multivariate
  function with such a Process, quality and reliability of predictions
  at test inputs, are demonstrated to be affected by the inhomogeneity
  parameter of the training data.

### [119] [Interval Prediction of Annual Average Daily Traffic on Local Roads via Quantile Random Forest with High-Dimensional Spatial Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18548)
*Ying Yao,Daniel J. Graham*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces an interval prediction approach using Quantile Random Forest with PCA to estimate AADT ranges with uncertainty quantification, achieving 88.22% coverage probability and improved interpretability for transport planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AADT estimation models provide only point predictions without uncertainty quantification, which is problematic given incomplete traffic detector coverage and underrepresentation of minor roads in national networks.

Method: Integration of Quantile Random Forest model with Principal Component Analysis to generate prediction intervals for AADT, using data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales.

Result: Achieved interval coverage probability of 88.22%, normalized average width of 0.23, and Winkler Score of 7,468.47, demonstrating effective uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The framework enhances both accuracy and interpretability of AADT estimation by combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional analysis, supporting more robust transport planning decisions.

Abstract: Accurate annual average daily traffic (AADT) data are vital for transport
planning and infrastructure management. However, automatic traffic detectors
across national road networks often provide incomplete coverage, leading to
underrepresentation of minor roads. While recent machine learning advances have
improved AADT estimation at unmeasured locations, most models produce only
point predictions and overlook estimation uncertainty. This study addresses
that gap by introducing an interval prediction approach that explicitly
quantifies predictive uncertainty. We integrate a Quantile Random Forest model
with Principal Component Analysis to generate AADT prediction intervals,
providing plausible traffic ranges bounded by estimated minima and maxima.
Using data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales, and evaluated with
specialized interval metrics, the proposed method achieves an interval coverage
probability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score
of 7,468.47. By combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional
analysis, this framework enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of
AADT estimation, supporting more robust and informed transport planning.

### [120] [A Frequentist Statistical Introduction to Variational Inference, Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18777)
*Yen-Chi Chen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper provides a Frequentist introduction to Variational Inference (VI), explaining how it connects classical Expectation-Maximization algorithms with modern generative models like VAEs and DDMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the disciplinary gap between statistics and machine learning by providing a unified Frequentist perspective on VI, making VAEs and DDMs more accessible to statisticians who typically approach VI from a Bayesian viewpoint.

Method: The paper explains VI theory from a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical EM algorithm and showing how VI emerges as a scalable solution for intractable E-steps, then extending this framework to VAEs and DDMs.

Result: The paper demonstrates how VAEs and DDMs are natural deep-learning-based extensions of the classical VI framework, showing the continuity between traditional statistical inference and modern generative AI.

Conclusion: By presenting VI, VAEs, and DDMs from a Frequentist viewpoint, the paper successfully bridges the gap between classical statistical inference and modern generative models, making these advanced techniques more accessible to statisticians.

Abstract: While Variational Inference (VI) is central to modern generative models like
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), its
pedagogical treatment is split across disciplines. In statistics, VI is
typically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machine
learning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint,
where VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. This creates a
barrier for statisticians, as the principles behind VAEs and DDMs are hard to
contextualize without a corresponding Frequentist introduction to VI. This
paper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for VI, VAEs, and DDMs
from a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show how VI arises as a scalable
solution for intractable E-steps and how VAEs and DDMs are natural,
deep-learning-based extensions of this framework, thereby bridging the gap
between classical statistical inference and modern generative AI.
