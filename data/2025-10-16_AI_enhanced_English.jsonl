We\nidentify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user\nbehavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across\ndifferent features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing\nbehaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To\nsolve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level\nredundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and\nproposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,\nAdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous\nbehaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to\nensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an\nincremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting\noutdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into\npopular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner.
