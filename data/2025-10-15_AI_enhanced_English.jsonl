However, these approaches have two main\nlimitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular\ninputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural\nfeatures; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to\ncatastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In\nthis paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an\ninstance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule\non-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)\nthat produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input\nmolecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,\nallowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular\ninput, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction\nand molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation\noutperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative\nimprovement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for\nquantum property prediction.

The proposed three-layer architecture consists of\nindividual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the\nmiddle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop\ncluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific\ncrop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model\nthat integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design\nenables both local specialization for individual crop types and global\ngeneralization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data\nprivacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models\nclosely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly\noutperforming standard machine learning models.

These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are\nspecifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL\ndivergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the\nL0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes.
