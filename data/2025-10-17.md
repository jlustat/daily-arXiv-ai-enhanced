Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable foundation for real-world device identification at scale, effectively addressing IoT security challenges in open-world environments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

### [2] [On the Identifiability of Tensor Ranks via Prior Predictive Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14523)
*Eliezer da Silva,Arto Klami,Diego Mesquita,Iñigo Urteaga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a rigorous method for determining rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor models using prior predictive moment matching, establishing an equivalence between rank identifiability and solvability of log-linear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for selecting latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization rely on heuristics, lacking rigorous approaches for determining rank identifiability.

Method: Transform moment matching conditions into log-linear systems of equations in terms of marginal moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; analyze solvability for different tensor models (PARAFAC/CP, Tensor Train, Tensor Ring, Tucker).

Result: PARAFAC/CP, Tensor Train, and Tensor Ring models have solvable systems and identifiable ranks, while Tucker model has underdetermined system and unidentifiable ranks. Derived explicit closed-form rank estimators for identifiable models.

Conclusion: The framework provides a rigorous approach to rank identifiability, with identifiable models yielding practical rank estimators based solely on observed data moments.

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

### [3] [Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting for Robust Gradual Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13864)
*Zixi Wang,Yushe Cao,Yubo Huang,Jinzhu Wei,Jingzehua Xu,Shuai Zhang,Xin Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STDW is a self-training method with dynamic weighting for gradual domain adaptation, using a time-varying parameter to balance source and target domain losses, outperforming baselines on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in gradual domain adaptation where traditional methods suffer from inefficient knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data during domain shift mitigation.

Method: Introduces dynamic weighting mechanism with time-varying hyperparameter ρ that adaptively balances source and target domain loss contributions, combined with self-training for pseudo-label generation and iterative model optimization.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and Cover Type dataset; ablation studies confirm the critical role of ρ's dynamic scheduling.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical insights and practical framework for robust gradual domain adaptation, effectively reducing domain bias and improving generalization in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

*Dongkwan Lee,Junhoo Lee,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Deep Edge Filter applies high-pass filtering to neural network features to improve generalization by isolating task-relevant high-frequency components while removing domain-specific low-frequency biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The hypothesis is that neural networks encode task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features.

Method: Subtract low-pass filtered outputs from original features to isolate generalizable representations while preserving architectural integrity.

Result: Experimental results across Vision, Text, 3D, and Audio domains show consistent performance improvements regardless of model architecture and data modality.

Conclusion: The method induces feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components, validating the core hypothesis that high-frequency features contain more generalizable information.

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

### [5] [CoLoR-GAN: Continual Few-Shot Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation in Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13869)
*Munsif Ali,Leonardo Rossi,Massimo Bertozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoLoR-GAN introduces a framework for continual few-shot learning in GANs using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce parameter growth while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods for GANs require adding significant new weights at each iteration, which becomes problematic for long-term learning. The paper aims to address this by developing a more parameter-efficient approach.

Method: The framework uses low-rank tensors for efficient model adaptation, introduces LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) for convolutional layers to optimize adapter size, and provides empirical guidance for LoRA hyperparameter selection.

Result: Experiments show CoLoR-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational resources compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CoLoR-GAN effectively handles both few-shot and continual learning in GANs through parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation, making it suitable for long-term learning scenarios.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

### [6] [Joint Discriminative-Generative Modeling via Dual Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13872)
*Xuwang Yin,Claire Zhang,Julie Steele,Nir Shavit,Tony T. Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel training framework that integrates adversarial training principles to simultaneously achieve robust classification and high-fidelity generative modeling, addressing limitations of Joint Energy-Based Models by replacing unstable SGLD-based training with stable AT-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM) which suffer from instability and poor sample quality due to SGLD-based training, while achieving both robust classification and high-quality generative modeling in a single framework.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) Replaces SGLD-based JEM learning with stable AT-based approach using BCE loss to discriminate real data from PGD-generated contrastive samples; (2) Synergistic adversarial training for discriminative component; (3) Two-stage training procedure to resolve incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.

Result: Substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, generative fidelity surpasses BigGAN and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets.

Conclusion: The approach addresses key stability issues limiting JEM scaling and demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for unified frameworks capable of both generating and robustly classifying visual data.

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

### [7] [K-frames: Scene-Driven Any-k Keyframe Selection for long video understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13891)
*Yifeng Yao,Yike Yun,Jing Wang,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao,Ke Tian,Zhihao Wang,Minghui Qiu,Tao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-frames introduces a scene-driven keyframe selection method that predicts semantically coherent clips instead of individual frames, enabling flexible any-k keyframe selection while preserving temporal continuity in long-video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keyframe selection methods for MLLMs suffer from information loss due to uniform sampling, and produce sparse, temporally disjointed frames that overlook scene continuity and lack flexibility for multi-scale selection.

Method: Proposes a three-stage progressive curriculum: two Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception, followed by Reinforcement Learning to optimize scene-driven prediction policy. Uses PeakClips dataset of 200K query-conditioned video highlights.

Result: Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate K-frames provides effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play keyframe selection at various scales.

Conclusion: K-frames offers a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe selection that preserves temporal continuity and enables flexible any-k frame selection, addressing limitations of existing methods in long-video understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

### [8] [Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer: From Backpropagation to Dynamic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14168)
*Guan-Horng Liu,Tianrong Chen,Evangelos A. Theodorou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes OCNOpt, a new neural network optimizer based on optimal control theory that connects backpropagation with dynamic programming, enabling higher-order training methods with improved robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the algorithmic resemblance between backpropagation in DNNs and optimality conditions in dynamical systems, particularly the connection to dynamic programming and the Bellman equation.

Method: The method involves interpreting DNNs as dynamical systems and solving approximate dynamic programming up to first-order expansion, leading to a new class of optimization methods that explore higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that OCNOpt improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining manageable computational complexity, and enables rich algorithmic opportunities including layer-wise feedback policies and game-theoretic applications.

Conclusion: OCNOpt paves new avenues for principled algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory, demonstrating the value of connecting deep learning optimization with optimal control frameworks.

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

### [9] [Multi-View Semi-Supervised Label Distribution Learning with Local Structure Complementarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13917)
*Yanshan Xiao,Kaihong Wu,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MVSS-LDL is a novel multi-view semi-supervised label distribution learning approach that leverages local structure complementarity across multiple views to improve classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDL methods only handle single-view problems with labeled data, but multi-view LDL with both labeled and unlabeled data remains unexplored. This paper aims to address this gap by developing the first multi-view semi-supervised LDL approach.

Method: The approach computes k-nearest neighbors for each view, then complements each view's neighbor set by incorporating neighbors from other views. A graph learning-based multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed using these complemented neighbor sets to leverage local structure complementarity.

Result: Numerical studies show that MVSS-LDL achieves significantly better classification performance compared to existing single-view LDL methods.

Conclusion: MVSS-LDL successfully addresses the multi-view semi-supervised LDL problem by exploiting local structure complementarity across views, representing the first attempt at multi-view label distribution learning.

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

*Jingwen Gu,Yiting He,Zhishuai Liu,Pan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DR-RPO is a model-free online policy optimization algorithm for robust RL that learns robust policies with sublinear regret using reference-policy regularization and linear function approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address decision-making under distribution shift in RL through robust MDPs, focusing on online settings where sample efficiency and exploration are critical, as policy optimization remains underexplored in robust RL.

Method: Proposes DR-RPO with reference-policy regularization for tractable optimization in softmax policy class, adopts d-rectangular linear MDP formulation with linear function approximation and upper confidence bonus for optimistic exploration.

Result: Achieves polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency matching value-based approaches, with empirical results demonstrating robustness across diverse domains.

Conclusion: Policy optimization can achieve strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance in robust RL, bridging the gap with value-based methods.

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

### [11] [Weight Weaving: Parameter Pooling for Data-Free Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13921)
*Levy Chaves,Eduardo Valle,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weight Weaving is a data-free model merging technique that pools weights across scaling parameter search spaces using various pooling functions, eliminating the need for evaluation data and improving performance of existing merging methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model merging methods heavily depend on scaling hyperparameters that require data for tuning, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. There's a need for principled data-free approaches to set these scaling factors.

Method: Weight Weaving pools model weights across lambda values search space using user-defined pooling functions like averaging, random selection, or existing model merging methods. It operates orthogonally to existing methods and requires no evaluation data.

Result: The method consistently improves performance across three ViT variants in vision multi-task learning, continual learning, and domain generalization setups, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9 percentage points in data-free settings.

Conclusion: Weight Weaving provides a modular, data-free approach to model merging that enhances existing methods without requiring evaluation data, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

TL;DR: A nonparametric data attribution method for diffusion models that measures influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images, without requiring model gradients or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution methods for diffusion models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings.

Method: Proposes a nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images, grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and extending to multiscale representations with convolution-based acceleration.

Result: The method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines, while producing spatially interpretable attributions.

Conclusion: The framework uncovers patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and outputs, independent of any specific model, providing an efficient and scalable attribution solution.

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

### [13] [LTR-ICD: A Learning-to-Rank Approach for Automatic ICD Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13922)
*Mohammad Mansoori,Amira Soliman,Farzaneh Etminani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach to ICD code assignment by treating it as both classification and ranking task, addressing the limitation of previous methods that ignored code order. The method outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers in both ranking accuracy and classification metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated ICD code assignment methods treat the problem as pure classification, ignoring the essential ordering of codes which is crucial for medical diagnosis and reimbursement purposes. The order of ICD codes carries important clinical significance.

Method: The paper approaches ICD code assignment from a retrieval system perspective, formulating it as a combined classification and ranking task to preserve code order information.

Result: The proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods: achieves 47% accuracy in ranking primary diagnosis codes (vs 20% for best classifier), and micro-/macro-F1 scores of 0.6065/0.2904 (vs 0.597/0.2660 for previous best model).

Conclusion: Treating ICD code assignment as a combined classification and ranking task enables better identification of high-priority codes and improves overall performance compared to pure classification approaches.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

*Daiqi Gao,Ziping Xu,Aseel Rawashdeh,Predrag Klasnja,Susan A. Murphy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Actively Observable Markov Decision Processes (AOMDPs) where agents can choose to measure latent states, balancing measurement costs against improved information. An online RL algorithm using belief states and sequential Monte Carlo methods is proposed and evaluated in digital health applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world RL settings, measuring states can be costly and negatively impact future outcomes. There's a need to balance the benefits of state information against measurement costs.

Method: Formulate AOMDPs as periodic partially observable MDPs, develop an online RL algorithm using belief states, and use sequential Monte Carlo methods to approximate posteriors of unknown parameters and latent states.

Result: The proposed approach shows that reduced uncertainty through selective measurements can provably improve sample efficiency and increase optimal policy value despite measurement costs.

Conclusion: AOMDPs provide a framework for cost-aware state measurement in RL, with practical applications in domains like digital health where intervention timing and assessment frequency must be optimized.

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

### [15] [Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972)
*George Webber,Andrew J. Reader*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distributional Consistency (DC) loss as a novel data-fidelity objective for inverse problems that replaces pointwise matching with distribution-level calibration, preventing overfitting to noise while maintaining compatibility with modern regularizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-fidelity loss functions like MSE lead to overfitting to noise by seeking pointwise agreement with noisy measurements. The authors aim to develop a more statistically grounded approach that evaluates data-fidelity collectively by testing statistical consistency with noise distributions.

Method: The proposed DC loss uses model-based probability scores for each measurement to achieve distribution-level calibration instead of pointwise matching. It serves as a plug-in replacement for standard data consistency terms, compatible with modern regularizers and optimized similarly to traditional losses.

Result: In image denoising with deep image prior, DC loss eliminates the need for early stopping and achieves higher PSNR. In medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances hand-crafted regularization efficacy.

Conclusion: DC loss provides a statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional fidelity losses for inverse problems, particularly effective when measurement-noise distribution is known and datasets contain many independent noisy values.

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

*Amandip Sangha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Geometric formulation of automatic differentiation using jet bundles and Weil algebras, showing reverse-mode AD as cotangent-pullback and Taylor-mode as evaluation in Weil algebras, with correctness proofs, error bounds, and efficient computation of mixed derivatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a geometric foundation for automatic differentiation theory using differential geometry concepts, enabling structure-preserving differentiation methods and addressing combinatorial complexity in higher-order derivatives.

Method: Uses jet bundles and Weil algebras to formulate AD geometrically, with reverse-mode as cotangent-pullback and Taylor-mode as Weil algebra evaluation. Introduces tensorized Weil algebras for efficient mixed derivative computation.

Result: Derived functorial identity for reverse-mode correctness, algebraic exactness for higher-order derivatives, explicit truncation error bounds, and linear-cost computation of all mixed derivatives avoiding combinatorial blow-up.

Conclusion: The geometric framework interprets AD through differential geometry, provides theoretical foundations for structure-preserving differentiation, and enables efficient computation of higher-order derivatives with practical applications in deep learning and scientific computing.

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

TL;DR: BitNet Distillation (BitDistill) is a lightweight pipeline that converts full-precision LLMs into 1.58-bit ternary models for specific tasks, achieving comparable performance with 10x memory savings and 2.65x faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient deployment of large language models on resource-constrained devices by reducing model precision while maintaining task-specific performance.

Method: Combines three key techniques: SubLN module from BitNet, multi-head attention distillation based on MiniLM, and continual pre-training as a warm-up step to bridge performance gaps.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to full-precision models across different model sizes while enabling 10x memory savings and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs.

Conclusion: BitDistill provides an effective approach for creating highly efficient 1.58-bit LLMs that maintain strong task-specific performance with significant computational benefits.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

### [18] [Interaction Concordance Index: Performance Evaluation for Interaction Prediction Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14419)
*Tapio Pahikkala,Riikka Numminen,Parisa Movahedi,Napsu Karmitsa,Antti Airola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IC-index, a new performance metric for evaluating drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction methods by measuring how well they capture interaction effects between drugs and targets, complementing existing prediction accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DTA prediction methods focus on predicting affinity values but don't adequately evaluate whether they capture interaction effects between drugs and targets, which is crucial for optimal allocation decisions like matching limited drug doses to their best targets.

Method: The authors propose interaction concordance index (IC-index) to evaluate prediction of interaction directions, analyze its theoretical properties including invariance to non-interaction-capturing predictors, and demonstrate that permutation equivariance in learning algorithms prevents interaction capture for unseen entities.

Result: Comprehensive empirical evaluation on biomedical datasets shows how different state-of-the-art ML algorithms perform on IC-index, revealing their varying abilities to capture interaction effects beyond standard prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: IC-index provides a valuable complement to existing DTA prediction metrics by specifically evaluating interaction effect prediction, which is essential for practical decision-making in drug-target allocation problems.

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

### [19] [Conditional Clifford-Steerable CNNs with Complete Kernel Basis for PDE Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14007)
*Bálint László Szarvas,Maksim Zhdanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses incompleteness in Clifford-Steerable CNNs' kernel basis by proposing Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels that use input-dependent kernels to improve model expressivity, showing superior performance on PDE forecasting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) where the kernel basis is incomplete, which restricts model expressivity and performance on tasks requiring equivariance to pseudo-Euclidean groups.

Method: The authors propose Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels that augment traditional kernels with equivariant representations computed from input feature fields. They derive equivariance constraints for these input-dependent kernels and solve them efficiently via implicit parameterization.

Result: Empirical results show improved expressivity on multiple PDE forecasting tasks including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where the proposed method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels successfully address the incompleteness issue in CSCNNs' kernel basis, leading to enhanced model expressivity and superior performance on equivariant learning tasks involving pseudo-Euclidean groups.

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

### [20] [Noise-Adaptive Layerwise Learning Rates: Accelerating Geometry-Aware Optimization for Deep Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14009)
*Jie Hao,Xiaochuan Gong,Jie Xu,Zhengdao Wang,Mingrui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme for geometry-aware optimization algorithms that accelerates DNN training by dynamically adjusting learning rates within layer groups based on gradient variance estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard geometry-aware optimizers use fixed learning rates for layers within the same norm group, but local curvature varies heterogeneously across layers and dynamically during training, making fixed rates inefficient.

Method: A noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme that estimates gradient variance in the dual norm on the fly and assigns time-varying, noise-adaptive learning rates within each layer group.

Result: Empirical results on transformer architectures (LLaMA and GPT) show faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers, with theoretical analysis confirming sharp convergence rates.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive learning rate scheme substantially accelerates DNN training compared to fixed-rate methods while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

### [21] [Seesaw: Accelerating Training by Balancing Learning Rate and Batch Size Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14717)
*Alexandru Meterez,Depen Morwani,Jingfeng Wu,Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Cengiz Pehlevan,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Seesaw is a principled batch-size scheduling framework that replaces learning rate halving with multiplying by 1/√2 and doubling batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing training time by ~36%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batch ramping can accelerate LLM pretraining, but optimal strategies for adaptive optimizers like Adam are unclear, leading to heuristic tuning. This work aims to develop a principled framework for batch-size scheduling.

Method: Theoretical analysis proves equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD and normalized SGD. Seesaw replaces standard learning rate halving with multiplying by 1/√2 while doubling batch size.

Result: Empirical tests on 150M/300M/600M parameter models show Seesaw matches cosine decay performance at equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by approximately 36%, approaching theoretical limits.

Conclusion: Seesaw provides a principled batch-ramping strategy that significantly accelerates training while maintaining performance, with theoretical foundations and empirical validation.

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

TL;DR: A new benchmark for Causal Representation Learning using high-fidelity simulated visual data that provides both realistic visual complexity and ground-truth causal processes, addressing the evaluation gap between synthetic datasets and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CRL evaluations suffer from a dilemma between realism and evaluative precision - they either use simplistic synthetic datasets or rely on downstream performance on real-world tasks without access to ground-truth causal variables and structures.

Method: Created a comprehensive dataset with around 200k images and 3M video frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis. The benchmark provides flexible access to underlying causal structures and allows modification to align with CRL assumptions.

Result: The benchmark offers a comprehensive testbed bridging rigorous evaluation and real-world applicability, covering static to dynamic settings, simple to complex structures, and single to multi-agent interactions. Representative CRL methods were evaluated across diverse paradigms.

Conclusion: This benchmark provides empirical insights to help practitioners choose appropriate CRL frameworks for specific real-world problems that can benefit from causal representation learning, while offering accessible ground-truth causal processes for proper evaluation.

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of limited/heterogeneous data due to privacy concerns and varying computation resources across clients in federated learning settings.

Method: Uses mixture of masked adapters for resource heterogeneity and bi-level optimization with masked personalization and client clustering for non-iid data.

Result: Shows significant performance and efficiency improvements over existing heterogeneous federated learning methods across various NLU tasks.

Conclusion: FedHFT effectively handles data and resource heterogeneity in federated fine-tuning while maintaining data privacy and improving efficiency.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and ethical concerns by developing efficient methods to remove specific data from trained models without full retraining.

Method: Use gradient ascent to reverse the influence of specific data points, leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent toward KKT conditions of margin maximization problems.

Result: For linear models and two-layer neural networks with high-dimensional data, properly scaled gradient ascent satisfies the proposed (ε,δ,τ)-successful unlearning criterion and approximates the retrained solution.

Conclusion: Gradient ascent is an effective method for machine unlearning that can remove specific data while preserving generalization performance on retained data.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

*Moritz Grillo,Tobias Hofmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a duality between sparse maxout networks and virtual polytopes, proving that depth hierarchies exist and width cannot compensate for insufficient depth under fixed indegree constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, which capture key characteristics of convolutional or graph neural networks, by linking their computational capabilities to geometric properties of polytopes.

Method: Established a duality between functions computable by sparse maxout networks and a class of virtual polytopes, derived tight bounds on polytope dimensions, and constructed depth hierarchies to analyze expressivity.

Result: Proved that sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are universal, but width alone cannot compensate for insufficient depth when there are fixed indegree constraints (sparsity limitations).

Conclusion: The geometric approach via virtual polytopes provides fundamental insights into the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, revealing that depth plays a crucial role that cannot be replaced by width under sparsity constraints.

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

TL;DR: Neural Effect Search is a novel method that discovers unknown causal effects directly from data using foundation models and sparse autoencoders, addressing multiple-testing issues and effect entanglement through progressive stratification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Randomized Controlled Trials rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis, which limits causal effect estimation at scale and may miss important effects. The goal is to enable unsupervised discovery of unknown treatment effects directly from data.

Method: The approach transforms unstructured trial data into meaningful representations using pretrained foundation models, then interprets them via sparse autoencoder. Neural Effect Search uses a recursive procedure with progressive stratification to address multiple-testing issues and effect entanglement.

Result: The algorithm demonstrated robustness in semi-synthetic experiments and successfully achieved the first unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial in experimental ecology.

Conclusion: Neural Effect Search enables scalable discovery of unknown causal effects directly from data, overcoming limitations of traditional hypothesis-driven approaches and opening new possibilities for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

### [28] [Identity-Link IRT for Label-Free LLM Evaluation: Preserving Additivity in TVD-MI Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14966)
*Zachary Robertson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that using identity link functions instead of logistic/probit transformations better preserves the additive structure of pairwise comparison data from large language model evaluations, enabling more efficient ranking with fewer comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient method for evaluating large language models using pairwise comparisons that preserves the geometric properties of the data while reducing the number of required evaluations.

Method: Proposes using identity link functions with item-response theory instead of traditional logistic/probit links, derived from Gini entropy maximization, resulting in a box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation.

Result: Achieves holdout RMSE of 0.117 ± 0.008 with 33% coverage while preserving agent rankings (Spearman ρ = 0.972 ± 0.015), requiring three times fewer evaluations than full dense comparison. Strong agreement between different judges (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) with ρ = 0.872.

Conclusion: Identity mapping best preserves TVD-MI's geometry for efficient LLM evaluation and is applicable to other bounded-response domains, outperforming traditional nonlinear link functions.

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity

*Haotian Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis showing that neural networks can approximate solutions to reaction-diffusion equations, with 2-layer networks sufficient for 1D problems and 3-layer networks for 2D problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While neural networks are increasingly used to solve differential equations, there's insufficient theoretical foundation explaining why they can effectively approximate such solutions.

Method: Theoretical analysis building upon the universal approximation theorem to demonstrate neural network approximation capabilities for reaction-diffusion equations in homogeneous and heterogeneous media.

Result: Proved that two-layer neural networks can approximate one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations, and three-layer networks can approximate two-dimensional versions. The framework is extendable to elliptic and parabolic equations.

Conclusion: Neural networks have strong expressive power for approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs, providing theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential equation solvers.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential
equation solvers.

*Simon Pedro Galeano Munoz,Mustapha Bounoua,Giulio Franzese,Pietro Michiardi,Maurizio Filippone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TENDE is a novel neural diffusion-based method for estimating transfer entropy that overcomes limitations of existing approaches by using score-based diffusion models to estimate conditional mutual information, providing flexible and scalable estimation with minimal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transfer entropy estimation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: TENDE leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional mutual information by learning score functions of the relevant conditional distributions, making minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process.

Result: The method demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks and real data.

Conclusion: TENDE provides a flexible, scalable approach for transfer entropy estimation that addresses key limitations in the literature and offers improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

*Zixian Yang,Sushil Mahavir Varma,Lei Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an online-learning-based pricing policy for two-sided markets with unknown demand/supply curves, achieving near-optimal tradeoff between regret, average queue length, and maximum queue length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design pricing and matching algorithms that maximize platform profit while maintaining reasonable queue lengths in two-sided markets where demand and supply curves are unknown in practice.

Method: A novel online-learning-based pricing policy with dynamic and probabilistic components that optimize the tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths, while resolving the tension between obtaining useful samples for learning and maintaining small queues.

Result: Proved a tradeoff among three metrics: Õ(T^(1-γ)) regret, Õ(T^(γ/2)) average queue length, and Õ(T^γ) maximum queue length for γ ∈ (0, 1/6], significantly improving over existing results. Showed this tradeoff is optimal up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: The proposed policy achieves near-optimal performance in balancing regret minimization and queue length control in two-sided markets with unknown demand/supply dynamics, matching the optimal performance of policies that assume known curves.

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

TL;DR: This review paper explores how pre-trained diffusion models combined with Monte Carlo methods can solve Bayesian inverse problems without additional training, using a twisting mechanism to guide simulations toward posterior distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have shown great potential as priors for Bayesian inverse problems, and there's a need to systematically review methods that leverage pre-trained models with Monte Carlo sampling without requiring retraining.

Method: The paper analyzes methods that use a twisting mechanism for intermediate distributions in the diffusion process, combined with various Monte Carlo sampling techniques to sample from the twisted distributions.

Result: The review provides a comprehensive overview of current approaches that successfully use pre-trained diffusion models with Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems.

Conclusion: Diffusion models serve as effective priors for Bayesian inverse problems when combined with Monte Carlo methods through twisting mechanisms, enabling posterior sampling without additional training requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the mechanisms behind emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning, specifically studying Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL) which solves long-horizon tasks without external rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what drives exploration in self-supervised reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly SGCRL, which can solve challenging goal-reaching tasks without external rewards or curricula.

Method: Combines theoretical analysis of SGCRL's objective function with controlled experiments to study how the algorithm's learned representations shape implicit rewards that drive exploration.

Result: Shows that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by learned representations, which automatically modify the reward landscape to promote exploration before goal achievement and exploitation after. The exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank state representations rather than neural network function approximation.

Conclusion: The improved understanding of SGCRL's exploration mechanisms enables adaptation of the algorithm to perform safety-aware exploration.

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

*Islam Akef Ebeid,Haoteng Tang,Pengfei Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel two-stage framework called ProtGram-DirectGCN for protein-protein interaction prediction using hierarchical n-gram graphs and a custom directed graph convolutional network that processes residue transition probabilities from protein sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for protein-protein interaction prediction use computationally intensive approaches like direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language Models or Graph Neural Networks for 3D structures. This study aims to explore less computationally intensive alternatives.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) ProtGram models protein primary structure as hierarchical n-gram graphs with residue transition probabilities defining edge weights, aggregated from large sequence corpus; (2) DirectGCN processes these directed graphs using separate path-specific transformations (incoming, outgoing, undirected, shared) combined via learnable gating mechanism, generating residue embeddings pooled via attention for protein-level embeddings.

Result: DirectGCN matches established methods on standard node classification benchmarks and excels at complex directed graphs with dense heterophilic structures. The full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power for PPI prediction, even with limited training data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective and computationally efficient alternative for protein-protein interaction prediction using hierarchical graph representations and specialized directed graph neural networks.

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates various ranking loss functions (pointwise, pairwise, listwise) for stock return forecasting using Transformer models, focusing on their impact on portfolio selection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current loss functions for stock prediction focus on accuracy but don't directly optimize for ranking stocks correctly, which is crucial for portfolio management. There's a lack of comprehensive comparison of advanced ranking losses in financial contexts with modern Transformer models.

Method: Systematic evaluation of diverse loss functions including pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches for daily stock return forecasting on S&P 500 data, using Transformer models to assess ranking performance for portfolio selection.

Result: The research provides a comprehensive benchmark showing how different loss functions affect model's ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns essential for effective portfolio selection.

Conclusion: The study offers practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based trading strategies by revealing the impact of various loss functions on stock ranking performance with Transformer models.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

### [38] [Towards Reversible Model Merging For Low-rank Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14163)
*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reversible Model Merging (RMM) is a new approach that constructs a compact basis from which original task-specific models can be recovered via linear combination, outperforming conventional merging methods for low-rank compressed models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional merging methods applied to low-rank weights (from LoRA or SVD) lead to severe performance degradation, and no merged model can consistently outperform specialized task-specific models.

Method: RMM reframes merging as generating a reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model. It provides a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and task-specific coefficients for linear combination.

Result: Extensive experiments show RMM consistently outperforms existing merging approaches and preserves the performance of low-rank compressed models by a significant margin.

Conclusion: RMM is an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that enables reversible model merging, allowing recovery of individual task-specific models when needed while maintaining strong performance across tasks.

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

TL;DR: MAFA is a production-deployed multi-agent framework that transforms enterprise annotation workflows through configurable agent collaboration, eliminating 1 million utterance backlogs at JP Morgan Chase with 86% human agreement while saving 5,000+ hours annually.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address critical annotation backlogs in financial services where millions of customer utterances require accurate categorization, bridging the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems and practical enterprise deployment.

Method: Combines specialized agents with structured reasoning and judge-based consensus mechanism, supporting dynamic task adaptation through configuration rather than code changes for custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, domain-specific categories).

Result: Eliminated 1 million utterance backlog with 86% average agreement with human annotators, saving over 5,000 hours annually; achieved 85% high, 10% medium, 5% low confidence classifications; 13.8% higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% better Top-5 accuracy, 16.9% improved F1 over baselines.

Conclusion: MAFA provides a blueprint for organizations facing annotation challenges, demonstrating consistent improvements across multiple datasets and languages while enabling human annotators to focus on ambiguous cases through reliable confidence-based filtering.

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

TL;DR: ConDA uses contrastive learning to organize diffusion model latent spaces for interpretable control, enabling nonlinear trajectory traversal that improves interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models generate well but lack organized latent spaces for interpretable control. Recent advances show contrastive learning can create more disentangled representations, motivating the alignment of diffusion embeddings with system dynamics.

Method: ConDA applies contrastive learning within diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics, organizing latents so traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors and enabling nonlinear trajectory traversal.

Result: Across fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression benchmarks, ConDA produces interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines.

Conclusion: Diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold, which ConDA successfully achieves.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, but faces practical limitations due to the participation dilemma where entities may be unwilling to contribute without receiving benefits.

Method: The work applies foundational concepts from economics and game theory alongside technology-driven solutions like blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. It presents a comprehensive taxonomy covering both centralized and decentralized architectures.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms are essential components for practical federated learning success, with applications in healthcare, smart infrastructure, vehicular networks, and blockchain systems.

Conclusion: While promising solutions have emerged, significant challenges remain in building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems through effective incentive mechanisms.

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first comprehensive spectral analysis of kernel ridge regression on molecular property prediction, challenging the common belief that richer kernel spectra lead to better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between kernel spectral properties and generalization performance in molecular property prediction, where kernel methods remain important for robustness in low-data regimes despite deep models achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

Method: Comprehensive spectral analysis of kernel ridge regression on QM9 dataset using molecular fingerprint, pretrained transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular properties, with four spectral metrics and truncated kernel experiments.

Result: Richer spectral features do not consistently improve accuracy; for transformer-based and local 3D representations, spectral richness can have negative correlation with performance. Truncated kernels show retaining only top 2% of eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the heuristic that richer spectra yield better generalization and highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and predictive performance, with implications for evaluating kernel and self-supervised learning methods in data-limited scientific tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

Motivation: To rigorously formalize the relationship between flat minima and adversarial robustness, challenging the longstanding but informal hypothesis that flat regions offer increased robustness.

Method: Derived a closed-form expression for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, used this to constrain loss variation in input space, and formally analyzed adversarial robustness of entire networks.

Result: Flatness implies local robustness but not global robustness; maintaining robustness beyond local neighborhoods requires sharp curvature away from data manifolds; adversarial examples lie in flat regions with confident wrong predictions.

Conclusion: The study challenges simplified views of flatness, providing a nuanced understanding that flat minima offer only local robustness while revealing the geometric structure governing adversarial vulnerability.

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

TL;DR: GenCluster is a scalable test-time compute framework that achieves IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models through large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and round-robin submission strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Competitive programming, particularly the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), serves as a key benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning capabilities. While proprietary models claim gold medal performance, achieving similar results with open-weight models remains challenging and requires transparent methods.

Method: The GenCluster framework combines large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under limited validation budgets.

Result: GenCluster achieves IOI gold medal-level performance with open-weight models, specifically demonstrating the ability to win a gold medal at IOI 2025 using gpt-oss-120b. The approach scales consistently with available compute.

Conclusion: This work sets a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible evaluation of reasoning in LLMs, narrowing the performance gap between open and closed systems in competitive programming benchmarks.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

*Lianzi Jiang,Jianxin Zhang,Xinyu Han,Huanhe Dong,Xiangrong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network (PhysAttnNet) is proposed for accurate motion response prediction of elastic Bragg breakwaters, addressing generalization limitations of conventional deep learning models through physics-informed attention mechanisms and hybrid loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional deep learning models have limited generalization capabilities for unseen sea states due to neglect of natural decay in marine systems and inadequate modeling of wave-structure interaction, which is critical for structural safety and operational integrity of elastic Bragg breakwaters.

Method: PhysAttnNet uses two specialized attention modules: decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) with learnable temporal decay to emulate natural decay, and phase differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) with cosine-based bias to capture wave-structure interactions. These are integrated via global context fusion and trained with hybrid time-frequency loss.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on wave flume datasets show PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms mainstream models, and cross-scenario generalization tests validate its robustness and adaptability to unseen marine environments.

Conclusion: PhysAttnNet demonstrates strong potential as a framework for developing predictive models for complex systems in ocean engineering, particularly for elastic Bragg breakwaters, by effectively incorporating physical priors and achieving superior generalization performance.

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks generalist vs specialist foundation models for PPG signal analysis, finding specialist models perform 27% better in full-tuning scenarios across 51 tasks covering cardiac assessment, lab value estimation, and cross-modal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are increasingly used in time-series analysis, but most are specialist models trained on single data types. Recent generalist models like MOMENT use multi-domain data, but their performance compared to specialists for physiological signals like PPG remains unclear.

Method: Comprehensive benchmarking study comparing generalist and specialist foundation models across 51 tasks involving PPG signals, evaluated through 7 dimensions: win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability.

Result: Specialist models achieved 27% higher win score than generalist models in full-tuning scenarios. The evaluation covered multiple performance metrics showing specialists' superior capability, adaptability, and robustness across diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Specialist foundation models outperform generalist models for PPG signal analysis tasks, demonstrating better performance, adaptability, and robustness. The study provides insights into model selection, training data importance, and performance characteristics for physiological time-series analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

*Zihao Fu,Ming Liao,Chris Russell,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST is a probe-free framework that analyzes transformer layers through direct matrix estimation and spectral analysis, revealing distinct behaviors between encoder and decoder models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms, and existing interpretability methods provide limited perspectives. CAST aims to complement these approaches by offering a novel spectral analysis perspective.

Method: CAST estimates transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse and applies spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics. It also uses kernel analysis (CKA similarity matrices) to examine functional relationships between layers.

Result: Analysis reveals decoder models exhibit compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank processing. CKA similarity matrices partition layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

Conclusion: CAST provides complementary insights to existing interpretability methods and successfully reveals distinct layer behaviors and functional patterns in transformer architectures through spectral analysis.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

*Mayank Keoliya,Seewon Choi,Rajeev Alur,Mayur Naik,Eric Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAREBench is a new benchmark for early event prediction that evaluates both predictive accuracy and temporal stability using multi-modal inputs (tabular EHR, ECG waveforms, clinical text), addressing gaps in current benchmarks that ignore stability and focus mainly on tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current early event prediction benchmarks ignore the temporal stability of risk scores and primarily evaluate on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior untested. This gap prevents assessment of deployability and clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

Method: Introduced CAREBench with six prediction tasks (including sepsis onset) using multi-modal inputs. Proposed a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz constants. Compared classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs.

Result: Existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points. Models show difficulty producing evidence-aligned, stable trajectories.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for models that produce evidence-aligned, stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings, as current methods fail to balance accuracy and stability effectively.

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

### [49] [Enhancing Time-Series Anomaly Detection by Integrating Spectral-Residual Bottom-Up Attention with Reservoir Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14287)
*Hayato Nihei,Sou Nobukawa,Yusuke Sakemi,Kazuyuki Aihara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SR-RC, combining spectral residual method with reservoir computing for improved time-series anomaly detection on edge devices without sacrificing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reservoir computing is suitable for edge AI but may require large reservoirs for good anomaly detection. Attention mechanisms can help but may reduce efficiency. Need a solution that improves performance without compromising RC's learning efficiency.

Method: Integrates spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism - with reservoir computing. SR-RC combines the hardware-friendly properties of both approaches.

Result: SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and logistic-regression models using SR-extracted values across benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets.

Conclusion: SR-RC provides a practical direction for deploying reservoir computing as Edge AI for time-series anomaly detection, combining the benefits of both spectral residual and reservoir computing approaches.

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

*Nam Le,Leo Yu Zhang,Kewen Liao,Shirui Pan,Wei Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TED++ is a submanifold-aware framework that detects subtle backdoor attacks by constructing tubular neighborhoods around class manifolds in hidden features and using Locally Adaptive Ranking to identify activations drifting outside admissible tubes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stealthy backdoor attacks pose severe security risks to deep neural networks, and existing defenses are vulnerable to subtle distance-based anomalies and limited clean data scenarios.

Method: Constructs tubular neighborhoods around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimates local thickness from clean activations, applies Locally Adaptive Ranking to detect drifting activations, and aggregates LAR-adjusted ranks across layers to capture input behavior on class submanifolds.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art detection performance under adaptive-attack and limited-data scenarios, with up to 14% gain in AUROC over next-best method, maintaining near-perfect detection with only five examples per class.

Conclusion: TED++ effectively detects subtle backdoors that evade existing defenses by leveraging submanifold-aware analysis and tube-constrained behavior characterization, demonstrating robust performance even with extremely limited clean data.

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.

*Shivam Singhal,Eran Malach,Tomaso Poggio,Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-ERM is a propose-and-verify framework that uses LLM-guided search over candidate programs with ERM-style selection, achieving sample-efficient learning of short programs where gradient-based methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between sample-efficient but computationally expensive program enumeration methods and computationally feasible but sample-inefficient gradient-based training for learning short programs.

Method: LLM-ERM draws k candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compiles and checks each on data, and returns the best verified hypothesis without feedback, adaptivity, or gradients.

Result: Empirically solves tasks like parity variants, pattern matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples.

Conclusion: Language-guided program synthesis recovers statistical efficiency of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond gradient-based training.

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTS-GT redesigns Graph Transformers with asymmetric attention and uses differentiable architecture search to select optimal GNN operators per layer, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing quantitative interpretability through causal ablation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph Transformers have rigid designs with fixed GNN types across layers and lack quantifiable interpretability, making it unclear whether performance gains come from meaningful patterns or spurious correlations.

Method: Redesign GT attention through asymmetry (queries from node features, keys/values from GNN transformations) and use Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity within transformer attention.

Result: DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 out of 8 benchmarks while remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing dataset-specific patterns. The interpretability framework shows visual attention salience doesn't always correlate with causal importance.

Conclusion: Graph Transformers don't need to choose between performance and interpretability - DARTS-GT demonstrates that heterogeneous architectures can achieve both state-of-the-art performance and improved interpretability through quantitative causal analysis.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: Stop-RAG is a value-based controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving in iterative RAG systems, improving efficiency and accuracy over fixed-iteration and LLM-based stopping methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iterative RAG systems face challenges with increasing latency, costs, and risk of distracting evidence with each additional retrieval loop, creating a need for efficient stopping strategies beyond predetermined iterations or unreliable confidence proxies.

Method: Cast iterative RAG as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and train Stop-RAG using full-width forward-view Q(λ) targets from complete trajectories, enabling adaptive stopping decisions while remaining compatible with black-box APIs.

Result: Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines and prompting-based stopping with LLMs on multi-hop question-answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: Adaptive stopping is a key missing component in current agentic systems, and value-based control can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of RAG systems.

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

*Andrew Zhao,Reshmi Ghosh,Vitor Carvalho,Emily Lawton,Keegan Hines,Gao Huang,Jack W. Stokes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization, revealing that systems are more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than injected queries, with feedback-based attacks increasing attack success rate by up to 48%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM systems now power everyday AI applications where performance depends on carefully designed prompts. While LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce manual effort by refining prompts from scored feedback, the security of this optimization stage remains underexamined.

Method: Using HarmBench, the researchers conducted systematic analysis of poisoning risks. They introduced a simple fake-reward attack that requires no access to the reward model and proposed a lightweight highlighting defense to mitigate vulnerabilities.

Result: Feedback-based attacks significantly raise attack success rate (ΔASR = 0.48). The fake-reward attack increased vulnerability, but the proposed highlighting defense reduced the fake-reward ΔASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization pipelines represent a first-class attack surface that requires stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks to ensure security in LLM systems.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization

### [55] [Revisit Modality Imbalance at the Decision Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14411)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals that modality imbalance in multimodal learning persists at the decision layer even after balanced optimization, with systematic bias toward certain modalities like audio. The bias stems from intrinsic feature-space and decision-weight disparities rather than optimization dynamics alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning suffers from modality imbalance where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones, and this paper aims to show that this imbalance manifests significantly at the decision layer beyond just representation learning.

Method: Experiments on audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) were conducted to analyze modality bias. The study examined feature-space disparities and decision-weight distributions to understand the root causes of imbalance.

Result: Even after extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit systematic bias toward certain modalities like audio. The bias originates from intrinsic disparities in feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization dynamics alone.

Conclusion: Future multimodal systems should incorporate adaptive weight allocation mechanisms at the decision layer to enable relative balance according to each modality's capabilities, rather than aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs that lead to biased decision-layer weighting.

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MergeMoE is an optimization-based method for compressing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by interpreting expert merging as inserting additional matrices into forward computation, achieving better performance than baselines at same compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models face substantial memory overhead, making compression an important research direction. Expert merging has been proposed but needs better theoretical foundation and optimization approaches.

Method: Theoretical analysis of expert merging from output perspective rather than parameter aggregation. Formulates merging as inserting additional matrices into forward computation, leading to optimization formulation. MergeMoE uses mathematical optimization to construct compression matrices.

Result: Evaluation on multiple MoE models shows MergeMoE consistently outperforms baseline methods with the same compression ratios.

Conclusion: The optimization-based approach to expert merging provides an effective method for compressing MoE models while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

### [57] [A Free Lunch in LLM Compression: Revisiting Retraining after Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14444)
*Moritz Wagner,Christophe Roux,Max Zimmer,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges conventional wisdom about LLM pruning by showing that reconstructing attention and MLP components separately within transformer blocks is more efficient and effective than full retraining, achieving better performance with less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational infeasibility of full retraining for LLM pruning and study the optimal granularity for weight reconstruction after pruning.

Method: Conducted extensive computational study on GPT architectures, comparing different reconstruction granularities (single matrices vs. transformer blocks) and pruning criteria like Wanda.

Result: Found that separate reconstruction of attention and MLP components is Pareto-optimal - most resource-efficient while achieving best perplexity, outperforming full retraining with fraction of memory.

Conclusion: Challenges the narrative that retraining should be avoided for LLM pruning; proper reconstruction can outperform full retraining and simple pruning criteria can beat complex approaches when reconstruction is executed correctly.

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

*Guillaume Rongier,Luk Peeters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to reproduce 3D fluvial deposits simulated by process-based models, showing successful transfer of 2D image generation techniques to 3D geological structures while maintaining training stability and avoiding mode collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative modeling approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological structures like fluvial deposits due to their continuity. The study aims to determine if GANs can effectively reproduce these complex geological formations.

Method: The researchers trained a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using training data generated by process-based models that mimic geological processes. They conducted an ablation study to test the transferability of 2D image generation techniques to 3D geological images.

Result: The GAN successfully reproduced non-stationarity and details of fluvial deposits without mode collapse or memorization of training data. Training remained stable, and the model could leverage additional properties like deposition time to validate performance using geological principles like the law of superposition.

Conclusion: GANs demonstrate robustness for generating specific geological structures, successfully transferring 2D techniques to 3D geological images. The approach shows promise for leveraging geological principles in deep generative models, though scalability to larger 3D images and multimodal datasets requires further investigation.

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive study on multi-class wine classification using One-vs-Rest logistic regression, comparing manual gradient descent with scikit-learn implementations and analyzing L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fundamental trade-offs between model accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability for production deployment in analytical chemistry, particularly for wine classification applications.

Method: Empirical study using One-vs-Rest logistic regression on UCI Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 features), comparing from-scratch gradient descent with scikit-learn solvers, and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity.

Result: Manual gradient descent achieved 92.59% accuracy with smooth convergence, while scikit-learn provided 24x speedup and 98.15% accuracy. L1 regularization achieved 54-69% feature reduction with only 4.63% accuracy decrease. An optimal 5-feature subset achieved 62% complexity reduction with 92-94% accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable guidelines for balancing comprehensive chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained environments, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance trade-offs with robust generalization and sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained
environments.

*Ling Zhang,Xianliang Yang,Juwon Yu,Park Cheonyoung,Lei Song,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents In-Context Approximation (ICA), a resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting in fine-tuning language models. ICA estimates data value without retraining by using in-context demonstrations, improving model alignment across various training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for identifying high-value training data rely on heuristics or expensive retraining, while noisy examples can dilute supervision during fine-tuning. There's a need for systematic and efficient ways to select optimal training data.

Method: In-Context Approximation (ICA) estimates holdout loss after training on candidate examples by conditioning on a small curated holdout set in context. It requires no reference model or additional finetuning, and under local linearization, it's equivalent to a first-order update toward the holdout optimum.

Result: ICA-based reweighting consistently improves model alignment across SFT, DPO, and SimPO training methods, with diverse backbones and datasets, achieving better performance with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: ICA provides a theoretically grounded, efficient framework for data selection that outperforms current methods, though it has limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates that warrant future research.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

TL;DR: The Guess2Graph (G2G) framework improves causal discovery with limited samples by using expert guesses to guide statistical tests rather than replacing them, maintaining statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery algorithms perform poorly with limited samples, and existing methods that integrate expert knowledge require perfect predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.

Method: Proposed Guess2Graph (G2G) framework with two instantiations: PC-Guess (augments PC algorithm) and gPC-Guess (learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage high-quality expert input). Both use expert guesses to guide the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them.

Result: Theoretically, both methods preserve correctness regardless of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented counterpart in finite samples when experts are 'better than random.' Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

Conclusion: The G2G framework provides a practical approach to improve causal discovery with limited samples by effectively integrating expert knowledge while maintaining statistical guarantees.

### [62] [Learning to Undo: Rollback-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Reversibility Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14503)
*Andrejs Sorstkins,Omer Tariq,Muhammad Bilal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reversible learning framework with two core mechanisms: a transition reversibility measure (Phi) and selective state rollback, which improves RL agent safety and performance by preventing catastrophic actions and integrating reversibility awareness into value functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible environments, where standard RL agents can make catastrophic decisions due to inability to recover from poor actions.

Method: Introduces Phi estimator to quantify state-action reversibility likelihood within horizon K, and selective rollback operation that returns agent to previous state when action yields unexpectedly low returns, preventing suboptimal trajectories.

Result: In CliffWalking v0: reduced catastrophic falls by 99.8% and increased mean episode return by 55%. In Taxi v3: suppressed illegal actions by ≥99.9% and improved cumulative reward by 65.7%, while significantly reducing reward variance in both environments.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves RL safety and performance through reversibility-aware evaluation and targeted rollback, with ablation studies confirming rollback mechanism as the critical component for these gains, representing progress toward safe sequential decision making.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Selective Representation Space (SRS) module with learnable patching and reassembly to enhance time series forecasting by creating flexible representation spaces instead of fixed adjacent patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional patching creates fixed representation spaces that limit expressiveness; need for selective representation spaces to include most informative patches for better forecasting.

Method: SRS module with Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle patches from contextual time series; SRSNet architecture combining SRS with MLP head.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains; can enhance existing patch-based models as plugin-and-play module.

Conclusion: SRS module effectively improves time series forecasting by creating flexible representation spaces that better exploit contextual information, demonstrated through superior performance on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

TL;DR: AEPO is an agentic RL algorithm that balances entropy in rollout and policy update phases to prevent training collapse in web agents, outperforming 7 mainstream RL algorithms across 14 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream agentic RL algorithms rely heavily on entropy signals for exploration, but excessive entropy reliance can cause training collapse and constraints in multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities.

Method: AEPO consists of: (1) dynamic entropy-balanced rollout with adaptive sampling budget allocation and branch penalty for consecutive high-entropy steps; (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization with stop-gradient operation on high-entropy clipping and entropy-aware advantage estimation.

Result: With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, 43.0% on WebWalker for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, 70.0% on WebWalker for Pass@5. Consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL algorithms.

Conclusion: AEPO improves rollout sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, enabling scalable web agent training by effectively balancing entropy in both rollout and policy update phases.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MX+ is a novel extension to block floating-point formats that addresses outlier precision issues in ultra low-bit formats for LLM serving, achieving better performance than 4-bit MX formats with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduced-precision formats are essential for cost-effective LLM serving, but existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle with outlier values that degrade model performance, while current solutions require intrusive framework modifications or are unconventional for widespread hardware adoption.

Method: MX+ extends microscaling (MX) formats by repurposing the exponent field of outlier elements as an extended mantissa, allowing increased precision for outliers without using their exponent field. This provides a cost-effective, non-intrusive solution that integrates seamlessly with existing MX formats.

Result: MX+ achieves significantly higher model performance compared to 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage overhead and slowdown, making it a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6 for efficient LLM inference.

Conclusion: MX+ successfully addresses the outlier precision problem in ultra low-bit BFP formats through a clever repurposing of exponent fields, offering improved LLM performance with minimal overhead while maintaining compatibility with existing industry-driven formats.

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data causes inaccurate predictions on OOD samples, and existing graph OOD detection methods suffer from structural redundancy that induces semantic shifts.

Method: Proposes RedOUT framework integrating structural entropy into test-time OOD detection, introduces ReGIB to decompose objective into essential information and irrelevant redundancy, minimizes structural entropy to reduce redundancy, and provides theoretical bounds for optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior OOD detection performance with 6.7% average improvement, significantly surpassing best competitor by 17.3% on ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Conclusion: RedOUT effectively addresses structural redundancy in graph OOD detection through structural entropy minimization and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

TL;DR: Conformal Labeling is a novel method that provides theoretical guarantees for AI model predictions by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) below a nominal level, ensuring a predefined fraction of AI-assigned labels is correct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing selective labeling methods lack theoretical guarantees on AI label quality, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling errors within AI-labeled subsets, despite AI models offering cost-effective alternatives to expensive human annotations.

Method: Construct conformal p-values for each test instance by comparing AI models' predicted confidence to calibration instances mislabeled by AI models, then select test instances whose p-values are below a data-dependent threshold to certify trustworthy AI predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate tight FDR control with high power across various tasks including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling provides a theoretically grounded approach to identify instances where AI predictions can be provably trusted, addressing the quality concerns in AI-assisted labeling while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Motivation: Existing methods for protein-ligand binding pose prediction struggle to balance speed, accuracy, and physical plausibility, creating a need for improved docking approaches.

Method: Three-stage flow matching pipeline operating on geometric spaces (ℝ³, SO(3), SO(2)) with learned scoring and unsupervised physical validity filters to refine docking predictions.

Result: Superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test sets in docking success rate and physical plausibility, with approximately 25x faster speed than modern large-scale co-folding models.

Conclusion: Matcha provides an effective solution for accurate and fast protein-ligand docking that balances computational efficiency with physical plausibility.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems are limited to unimodal textual data, which restricts their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal documents containing text, images, tables, equations, and graphs that each provide unique information.

Method: MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal using a modality-aware knowledge graph that encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships, enabling both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across diverse modalities.

Result: Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets show MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.486 with complete modality coverage.

Conclusion: MAHA establishes a scalable and interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data through the combination of embeddings with explicit document structure.

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal

where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and
interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling
modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.

TL;DR: FAL is an efficient transformer architecture that eliminates MHA-MLP connections to reduce communication overhead in distributed training, achieving up to 44% training time reduction and better perplexity than baseline GPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer designs suffer from significant communication overhead in Tensor Parallelism, particularly the all-reduce communication required for each block's MHA-MLP connection.

Method: Proposes FAL which redirects first MHA output to MLP inputs of following layers, eliminating per-block MHA-MLP connections. FAL+ adds normalized first attention output to subsequent MHA outputs to enhance MLP input quality.

Result: FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to 44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better perplexity than baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity without increasing training time.

Conclusion: The proposed FAL architecture effectively reduces communication overhead in distributed transformer training while maintaining or improving model quality, making it a practical solution for efficient large-scale transformer training.

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

*Zhuo Cao,Xuan Zhao,Lena Krieger,Hanno Scharr,Ira Assent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LeapFactual is a novel counterfactual explanation algorithm using conditional flow matching to generate reliable counterfactuals even when learned and true decision boundaries diverge, applicable to non-differentiable models and human-in-the-loop systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current counterfactual explanation methods suffer from gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and overreliance on decision boundary alignment, limiting their reliability in high-stakes domains like healthcare and scientific research.

Method: Proposes LeapFactual based on conditional flow matching, which is model-agnostic and can handle non-differentiable models and human-in-the-loop systems.

Result: Extensive experiments show LeapFactual generates accurate, in-distribution counterfactual explanations that provide actionable insights and can be used as new training data to enhance models.

Conclusion: LeapFactual is broadly applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert interpretability in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

TL;DR: Extending encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow for galaxy morphology classification, providing both good predictive performance and explainable counterfactual explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Galaxy morphology classification is laborious for large datasets, and existing machine learning approaches lack interpretability, making results difficult to understand and explain.

Method: Extend classical encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow to enable counterfactual explanations while maintaining predictive performance.

Result: The approach achieves good predictive performance for galaxy morphology classification while providing additional decision process information.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully combines predictive accuracy with explainability through counterfactual explanations for galaxy morphology analysis.

Abstract: Galaxy morphologies play an essential role in the study of the evolution of
galaxies. The determination of morphologies is laborious for a large amount of
data giving rise to machine learning-based approaches. Unfortunately, most of
these approaches offer no insight into how the model works and make the results
difficult to understand and explain. We here propose to extend a classical
encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow, allowing us to not only
obtain a good predictive performance but also provide additional information
about the decision process with counterfactual explanations.

### [73] [Geometric Moment Alignment for Domain Adaptation via Siegel Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14666)
*Shayan Gharib,Marcelo Hartmann,Arto Klami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised domain adaptation method using Riemannian geometry to align source and target distributions by representing first- and second-order moments as symmetric positive definite matrices, enabling simultaneous moment adaptation through Siegel embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing domain adaptation methods use ad-hoc similarity measures for moment alignment, lacking principled geometric foundations. The authors aim to leverage intrinsic distribution geometry for more faithful cross-domain comparison.

Method: Proposes representing first- and second-order moments as single SPD matrices via Siegel embeddings, then aligning distributions using Riemannian distance on the SPD manifold to preserve mean and covariance structure simultaneously.

Result: Validated on image denoising and classification benchmarks, with theoretical connection established between Riemannian manifold distance and target-domain error bound. Code publicly available.

Conclusion: The Riemannian geometric approach provides a principled alternative for domain adaptation that better preserves distribution structure and enables more faithful cross-domain alignment compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

*Junya Shiraishi,Jiechen Chen,Osvaldo Simeone,Petar Popovski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A low-power online anomaly detection framework using neuromorphic wireless sensor networks with FDR control and dynamic sensor querying optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable anomaly detection in applications like brain-machine interfaces and environmental monitoring while maintaining low power consumption and controlling false discovery rates.

Method: Uses neuromorphic sensor nodes that produce event-driven spikes, impulse radio transmissions, online hypothesis testing with e-values for FDR control, and multi-armed bandit framework for dynamic sensor querying optimization.

Result: The framework reliably detects anomalies under stringent FDR requirements while efficiently scheduling sensor communications and achieving low detection latency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines neuromorphic sensing, FDR-controlled detection, and adaptive sensor scheduling for effective low-power anomaly detection.

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

*Maulidi Adi Prasetia,Muhamad Risqi U. Saputra,Guntur Dharma Putra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPPA is a personalized federated learning method that addresses model and data heterogeneity by progressively aligning client model weights with the global model while preserving local knowledge, using entropy-based weighted averaging for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces challenges with client heterogeneity in computational resources and non-IID data distributions. Existing PFL approaches overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity from clients with diverse capabilities.

Method: Progressive Parameter Alignment (FedPPA) progressively aligns weights of common layers across clients with global model weights, mitigates inconsistencies between global and local models, preserves local knowledge, and integrates entropy-based weighted averaging.

Result: Experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior performance in personalized adaptation.

Conclusion: FedPPA effectively addresses model and data heterogeneity in federated learning, providing robust personalization in non-IID settings while maintaining strong global model performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tawa is an automated compiler that generates high-performance, warp-specialized GPU code from high-level tile-based programs, achieving speedups over optimized libraries while reducing programming complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The SIMT programming model is misaligned with modern GPU's task-parallel hardware, creating a programmability gap. Hardware-level warp specialization requires manual orchestration of complex communication and pipelines, which is labor-intensive and error-prone.

Method: Tawa uses a novel IR abstraction called asynchronous references (aref) to express warp-level communication without exposing hardware details. It automatically partitions programs into producer-consumer roles and manages dataflow pipelines.

Result: On NVIDIA H100 GPUs, Tawa achieves up to 1.1× speedup over cuBLAS GEMM kernels and 1.2× speedup over Triton for attention workloads. It matches the performance of hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with significantly less programming effort.

Conclusion: Tawa successfully bridges the programmability gap in GPU computing by automating warp specialization, delivering high performance while reducing development complexity and manual effort.

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

TL;DR: INDAGO-Nexus is a multi-objective search approach that discovers diverse failure scenarios for DRL agents by jointly optimizing failure likelihood and test scenario diversity, outperforming existing single-objective methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools like INDAGO focus only on maximizing failure counts, which doesn't ensure scenario diversity or reveal distinct error types in safety-critical DRL testing.

Method: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity metrics and Pareto front selection strategies to jointly optimize for failure likelihood and test scenario diversity.

Result: INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures than INDAGO in SDC and Parking scenarios respectively, while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

Conclusion: The multi-objective approach significantly improves test effectiveness by discovering more diverse failure scenarios more efficiently than single-objective optimization methods.

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

TL;DR: Future Summary Prediction (FSP) trains models to predict compact representations of long-term future content, addressing limitations of next-token prediction and multi-token prediction for long-horizon reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-token prediction struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative writing due to teacher-forced training. Multi-token prediction helps but only captures short-range dependencies. There's a need for better methods that can handle long-term dependencies.

Method: Proposes Future Summary Prediction (FSP) with two variants: handcrafted summaries (e.g., bag of words) and learned summaries using embeddings from a reverse language model trained from right to left. Uses an auxiliary head to predict compact representations of long-term future content.

Result: Large-scale pretraining experiments with 3B and 8B-parameter models show FSP provides improvements over both next-token prediction and multi-token prediction across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: FSP effectively addresses limitations of existing prediction methods by enabling models to capture long-term dependencies and preserve information relevant for long-form generations, demonstrating superior performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of passive crowdsourced methods by adaptively guiding mobile agents to collect high-utility RSS measurements while considering urban obstacles and mobility constraints.

Method: Modified A* algorithm (A-UCB*) that incorporates acquisition values into trajectory costs for high-acquisition planned paths, combined with Bayesian optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPHeRe is a novel unsupervised Hebbian learning method that integrates orthogonality constraints and structural information preservation through local auxiliary blocks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks while demonstrating effectiveness in continual learning and transfer scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Hebbian learning suffers from unconstrained connection updates and lack of feedback mediation, limiting its scalability to complex networks and tasks. The authors aim to overcome these limitations while maintaining biological plausibility.

Method: SPHeRe uses orthogonality constraints to bound update magnitudes and incorporates structural information preservation through local auxiliary nonlinear blocks. A lightweight projection provides feedback mediation by backpropagating structural loss to the input.

Result: SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic plasticity approaches on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. It also shows strong effectiveness in continual learning, transfer learning, and image reconstruction tasks, demonstrating robust and generalizable feature extraction.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the competitiveness of Hebbian unsupervised learning in modern deep learning frameworks, showing potential for efficient biologically-inspired algorithms without strict dependence on backpropagation.

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is

TL;DR: PA-DST (Permutation-Augmented Dynamic Sparse Training) combines structured sparsity with learned permutations to match unstructured DST accuracy while achieving faster training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured sparsity provides computational efficiency on GPUs but sacrifices accuracy compared to unstructured dynamic sparse training due to limited expressivity in fixed layouts.

Method: Learn a single permutation matrix per layer jointly with structured weight matrix, applied to block, N:M, and diagonal structures.

Result: Matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90-95% sparsity on ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), with 1.21× faster training and 2.9× faster inference.

Conclusion: Structure + learned permutation provides an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency for sparse training.

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ShifTS, a method-agnostic framework that addresses both temporal shift and concept drift in time-series forecasting by first mitigating temporal shifts and then handling concept drift using a soft attention mechanism to find invariant patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series data exhibits dynamic distribution shifts over time, with existing studies primarily focusing on temporal shift while concept drift methods receive less attention. Conventional concept drift methods face challenges in time-series forecasting, creating a need for proper handling of both types of distribution shifts.

Method: The authors introduce ShifTS framework that first addresses temporal shift and then concept drift. It uses a soft attention mechanism to find invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series, providing a unified approach to handle both types of distribution shifts.

Result: Extensive experiments show ShifTS consistently enhances forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets, outperforming existing concept drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

Conclusion: ShifTS effectively addresses both temporal shift and concept drift in time-series forecasting, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods and providing a comprehensive solution for handling distribution shifts in time-series data.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

TL;DR: Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models combine LLM-generated feature functions with decision trees to create interpretable, efficient predictors that can compete with neural networks without requiring specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between interpretable classical models (like decision trees) that need manual feature engineering and neural networks that learn representations automatically but lack interpretability and require specialized hardware.

Method: Two algorithms: 1) Adaptation of FunSearch to learn feature functions using LLMs, 2) Novel ID3 variant that generates new features on demand during decision tree leaf splitting. Features are represented as code functions synthesized by LLMs.

Result: In experiments across chess evaluation, image classification, and text classification, LeaPR models achieved neural network-competitive performance without using neural networks, while maintaining full interpretability.

Conclusion: LeaPR provides a flexible paradigm for end-to-end learning of interpretable representations where both features and predictions can be easily inspected and understood, offering a viable alternative to neural networks for interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

### [85] [Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic Reward Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14837)
*Jan Corazza,Ivan Gavran,Daniel Neider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces stochastic reward machines to handle noisy rewards in reinforcement learning, with a constraint-solving algorithm that learns minimal models from agent explorations and guarantees optimal policy convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward machine learning algorithms assume noise-free rewards, which is impractical for real-world applications where rewards can be noisy.

Method: Proposes stochastic reward machines and a constraint-solving algorithm that learns minimal models from RL agent explorations, compatible with existing RM algorithms.

Result: The algorithm outperforms existing methods and naive approaches for handling noisy rewards in two case studies.

Conclusion: Stochastic reward machines effectively handle noisy reward functions in reinforcement learning, with the proposed algorithm providing convergence guarantees to optimal policies.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

### [86] [Backdoor Unlearning by Linear Task Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14845)
*Amel Abdelraheem,Alessandro Favero,Gerome Bovet,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to remove backdoor attacks from foundation models without compromising their general capabilities, leveraging the disentanglement of backdoor encodings from benign tasks in the model weight space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations and backdoor attacks, but existing removal approaches degrade performance on other tasks. The authors investigate whether backdoors can be removed without compromising the models' general capabilities.

Method: The method leverages the finding that backdoors are disentangled from other benign tasks in the model weight space. This enables isolation and erasure of backdoor influence with minimal impact on clean performance. The approach works both with known attacks and when attacks are unknown by using reverse-engineered triggers.

Result: The method achieves approximately perfect unlearning of backdoors while retaining 96% of clean accuracy on average. It works effectively with CLIP-based models and common adversarial triggers, and outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Backdoors can be successfully removed from foundation models without compromising their general capabilities by leveraging the disentanglement of backdoor encodings from benign tasks in the weight space, providing a practical defense against backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

### [87] [Predicting kernel regression learning curves from only raw data statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14878)
*Dhruva Karkada,Joseph Turnbull,Yuxi Liu,James B. Simon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical framework called Hermite Eigenstructure Ansatz (HEA) that predicts kernel regression learning curves on real datasets using only data covariance and target function decomposition, showing real image data behaves "Gaussian enough" for the approximation to work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an end-to-end theory that can predict learning performance from dataset structure for nontrivial learning algorithms on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between theoretical analysis and practical applications.

Method: Proposes Hermite Eigenstructure Ansatz (HEA) - an analytical approximation of kernel eigenvalues/eigenfunctions with respect to anisotropic data distributions, validated on Gaussian data and tested on real datasets (CIFAR-5m, SVHN, ImageNet) using empirical covariance matrices and target function polynomial decompositions.

Result: The HEA framework successfully predicts learning curves for kernel regression on real image datasets, and extends to showing MLPs in feature-learning regimes learn Hermite polynomials in the predicted order, demonstrating the approach works well in practice.

Conclusion: The HEA framework provides a proof-of-concept that end-to-end theories mapping dataset structure to model performance are possible for complex learning algorithms on real datasets, with real image data being sufficiently "Gaussian" for the approximation to hold.

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

### [88] [Learning When Not to Learn: Risk-Sensitive Abstention in Bandits with Unbounded Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14884)
*Sarah Liaw,Benjamin Plaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cautious bandit algorithm for high-stakes AI applications where actions can cause irreparable damage. The model uses a two-action contextual bandit with abstention to avoid catastrophic errors when no mentor is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard bandit algorithms assume all errors are recoverable, but in high-stakes applications, single actions can cause irreparable damage. Existing approaches rely on mentors that may not always be available.

Method: A caution-based algorithm that learns when not to learn by choosing a trusted region and committing only where evidence doesn't certify harm. Uses two-action contextual bandit with abstain option and assumes Lipschitz commit rewards.

Result: The algorithm achieves sublinear regret guarantees under i.i.d. inputs, demonstrating effective cautious exploration for safe deployment in high-stakes environments.

Conclusion: Cautious exploration through abstention and trusted regions enables safe learning in high-stakes applications without requiring constant mentor availability, with theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

### [89] [Reasoning with Sampling: Your Base Model is Smarter Than You Think](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14901)
*Aayush Karan,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simple iterative sampling algorithm using base LLMs' own likelihoods to achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to RL-posttraining, without additional training or verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether comparable reasoning capabilities can be elicited from base models at inference time through pure sampling, rather than requiring RL posttraining, and to avoid the diversity collapse characteristic of RL methods.

Method: Proposes an iterative sampling algorithm inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for sampling from sharpened distributions, leveraging base models' own likelihoods without additional training.

Result: The algorithm offers substantial reasoning boosts that nearly match and even outperform RL-posttraining on tasks like MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA, while avoiding diversity collapse over multiple samples.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains, requiring no training, curated datasets, or verifiers, suggesting base models can achieve strong reasoning through pure sampling at inference time.

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

*Elena Golimblevskaia,Aakriti Jain,Bruno Puri,Ammar Ibrahim,Wojciech Samek,Sebastian Lapuschkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WeightLens and CircuitLens are two new methods that improve neural network interpretability by analyzing learned weights and feature interactions, overcoming limitations of activation-only approaches and manual circuit discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods rely on manual inspection (limited to toy tasks) or automated approaches that miss feature interactions and depend heavily on external LLMs/datasets. There's a need for more systematic, scalable circuit analysis.

Method: WeightLens interprets features directly from learned weights without explainer models or datasets. CircuitLens captures how feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing circuit-level dynamics.

Result: WeightLens matches or exceeds performance of existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens reveals circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify. Together they increase interpretability robustness.

Conclusion: These methods enhance scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and quality, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit analysis beyond activation-based approaches.

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

### [91] [Efficient Parallel Samplers for Recurrent-Depth Models and Their Connection to Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14961)
*Jonas Geiping,Xinyu Yang,Guinan Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion forcing sampler that accelerates generation in recurrent-depth language models by enabling parallel token refinement through recurrence, achieving up to 5x speedup without tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language models, and leverage their similarities to develop more efficient generation methods that can utilize the extra computation in recurrent-depth architectures.

Method: Developed a diffusion forcing sampler that decodes new tokens at every forward pass while allowing parallel refinement of latent states through recurrence, based on principles from diffusion literature.

Result: The sampler provides strictly more expressive generation than baseline autoregressive methods with the same time budget, and achieves up to 5x speedup when applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without any tuning.

Conclusion: Recurrent-depth models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal, diffusion language models, and the proposed sampler provides an efficient mechanism for parallelizing their extra computation at inference.

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

*Katiana Kontolati,Rini Jasmine Gladstone,Ian Davis,Ethan Pickering*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BINNs integrate SNPs with multi-omics data and biological knowledge to improve genomic prediction and selection in crops, achieving up to 56% higher accuracy than traditional methods while identifying nonlinear biological relationships missed by conventional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional genotype-to-phenotype models have limited accuracy, requiring costly field trials. Models using intermediate molecular phenotypes are impractical for genomic selection since such data is unavailable during deployment. BINNs overcome this by leveraging multi-omics data only during training while using genotype data alone during inference.

Method: BINNs encode pathway-level inductive biases and integrate thousands of SNPs with multi-omics measurements and prior biological knowledge. They use multi-omics data during training but only genotype data during inference, allowing practical genomic selection applications.

Result: BINN improved rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across subpopulations under sparse-data conditions. It identified genes that GWAS/TWAS failed to uncover and reduced prediction error by 75% relative to conventional neural nets in synthetic benchmarks. BINN latent variables correlated with experimental quantities despite not being trained on them.

Conclusion: BINNs learn biologically-relevant representations from genotype to phenotype and establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to improve genomic prediction accuracy. They reveal nonlinear biological relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection, pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: π-Flow introduces policy-based flow models that predict dynamic flow velocities for fast ODE integration without extra network evaluations, achieving better quality-diversity trade-off than existing few-step methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-step diffusion/flow models suffer from complex distillation procedures and quality-diversity trade-offs due to format mismatch between teacher and student models.

Method: Modifies student flow model output to predict network-free policies that generate dynamic flow velocities at future substeps, using imitation distillation with ℓ₂ flow matching loss to match teacher's behavior along policy trajectory.

Result: Achieves 1-NFE FID of 2.85 on ImageNet 256², outperforming MeanFlow with same DiT architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, achieves substantially better diversity while maintaining teacher-level quality.

Conclusion: π-Flow enables stable and scalable training by simply mimicking teacher behavior, avoiding quality-diversity trade-off and outperforming state-of-the-art few-step methods.

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

*Tadao Hoshino*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper develops a sensitivity analysis framework for transferring average total treatment effects (ATTE) from source data with observed networks to target data with unknown networks, using Wasserstein distance to measure network uncertainty and linear programming to construct bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating social policy impacts when network data is available in source datasets but completely unknown in target datasets, requiring a method to transfer treatment effects while accounting for network uncertainty.

Method: Uses a sensitivity analysis based on uncertainty in target network's degree distribution measured by Wasserstein distance from reference distribution, constructs bounds on target ATTE using linear programming estimator, and develops wild bootstrap approach for distribution approximation.

Result: Developed a framework that can bound the ATTE for target data with unknown networks, with theoretical derivation of the limiting distribution of bound estimators and practical bootstrap implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed sensitivity analysis framework successfully enables transfer of treatment effects from source to target data despite complete network unobservability in target data, with empirical application to farmers' insurance adoption study demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: This paper develops a sensitivity analysis framework that transfers the
average total treatment effect (ATTE) from source data with a fully observed
network to target data whose network is completely unknown. The ATTE represents
the average social impact of a policy that assigns the treatment to every
individual in the dataset. We postulate a covariate-shift type assumption that
both source and target datasets share the same conditional mean outcome.
However, because the target network is unobserved, this assumption alone is not
sufficient to pin down the ATTE for the target data. To address this issue, we
consider a sensitivity analysis based on the uncertainty of the target
network's degree distribution, where the extent of uncertainty is measured by
the Wasserstein distance from a given reference degree distribution. We then
construct bounds on the target ATTE using a linear programming-based estimator.
The limiting distribution of the bound estimator is derived via the functional
delta method, and we develop a wild bootstrap approach to approximate the
distribution. As an empirical illustration, we revisit the social network
experiment on farmers' weather insurance adoption in China by Cai et al.
(2015).

It extends these models to handle mixed data types (binary/ordinal) and multiple spatially/temporally related datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient Bayesian inference methods for complex multivariate models that can capture both latent factor structures across time/space and residual conditional dependencies through graphical models, particularly for datasets with mixed variable types and spatial/temporal relationships.

Method: The authors propose efficient MCMC algorithms for single-factor graphical models, which integrate Gaussian graphical models for correlated residuals with latent factor structures. They extend these models to handle binary and ordinal categorical variables, and to model multiple datasets with spatial or temporal dependencies.

Result: The paper demonstrates the application of single-factor graphical models through both simulated examples and real-world case studies, showing the models' ability to capture multivariate associations through latent factors across time/space while modeling residual conditional dependencies.

Conclusion: Single-factor graphical models provide a flexible framework for Bayesian inference that can simultaneously capture latent factor structures and residual conditional dependencies, making them suitable for analyzing complex multivariate datasets with spatial/temporal relationships and mixed data types.

Abstract: We introduce efficient MCMC algorithms for Bayesian inference for
single-factor models with correlated residuals where the residuals'
distribution is a Gaussian graphical model. We call this family of models
single-factor graphical models. We extend single-factor graphical models to
datasets that also involve binary and ordinal categorical variables and to the
modeling of multiple datasets that are spatially or temporally related. Our
models are able to capture multivariate associations through latent factors
across time and space, as well as residual conditional dependence structures at
each spatial location or time point through Gaussian graphical models. We
illustrate the application of single-factor graphical models in simulated and
real-world examples.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new identifiability condition for multi-VAR models using communication-efficient data integration, achieving better convergence rates tailored to individual subjects' sparsity and sample sizes, along with hypothesis tests for path significance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-VAR models suffer from statistical inefficiency due to using weighted median for common effects, leading to convergence rates limited by the least sparse subject and smallest sample size across all subjects.

Method: A communication-efficient data integration framework with new identifiability condition for multi-VAR models, developing hypothesis tests using Wald-type statistics from individual debiased estimators to assess path nullity, homogeneity, and common path significance.

Result: The proposed approach achieves convergence rates tailored to each subject's sparsity level and sample size, outperforming existing benchmarks in simulation studies under various heterogeneity scenarios and real data applications.

Conclusion: The new identifiability condition and communication-efficient framework significantly improve statistical efficiency in multi-VAR models, providing better convergence rates and robust hypothesis testing capabilities for heterogeneous network Granger causality analysis.

Abstract: The multiple-subject vector autoregression (multi-VAR) model captures
heterogeneous network Granger causality across subjects by decomposing
individual sparse VAR transition matrices into commonly shared and
subject-unique paths. The model has been applied to characterize hidden shared
and unique paths among subjects and has demonstrated performance compared to
methods commonly used in psychology and neuroscience. Despite this innovation,
the model suffers from using a weighted median for identifying the common
effects, leading to statistical inefficiency as the convergence rates of the
common and unique paths are determined by the least sparse subject and the
smallest sample size across all subjects. We propose a new identifiability
condition for the multi-VAR model based on a communication-efficient data
integration framework. We show that this approach achieves convergence rates
tailored to each subject's sparsity level and sample size. Furthermore, we
develop hypothesis tests to assess the nullity and homogeneity of individual
paths, using Wald-type test statistics constructed from individual debiased
estimators. A test for the significance of the common paths can also be derived
through the framework. Simulation studies under various heterogeneity scenarios
and a real data application demonstrate the performance of the proposed method
compared to existing benchmark across standard evaluation metrics.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new estimand called complier general causal effect (CGCE) to address one-sided noncompliance in randomized controlled trials, and develops efficient estimation methods under minimal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for causal inference but can be compromised by one-sided noncompliance, which undermines the validity of treatment effect estimates.

Method: The authors propose the CGCE estimand and investigate conditions for efficient estimation under minimal assumptions, using simulation studies and real data application for validation.

Result: The proposed CGCE provides a general framework for characterizing causal effects among compliers, with efficient estimation achievable under specific conditions.

Conclusion: The CGCE offers a robust approach for handling one-sided noncompliance in RCTs, with efficient estimation methods that outperform existing approaches in certain scenarios.

Abstract: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is widely regarded as the gold standard
for assessing the causal effect of a treatment or intervention, assuming
perfect implementation. In practice, however, randomization can be compromised
for various reasons, such as one-sided noncompliance. In this paper, we address
the issue of one-sided noncompliance and propose a general estimand, the
complier general causal effect (CGCE), to characterize the causal effect among
compliers. We further investigate the conditions under which efficient
estimation of the CGCE can be achieved under minimal assumptions. Comprehensive
simulation studies and a real data application are conducted to illustrate the
proposed methods and to compare them with existing approaches.

### [98] [Hypothesis testing for the uniformity of random geometric graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14210)
*Mingao Yuan*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper proposes the first statistical test to determine if the node distribution in random geometric graphs is uniform or non-uniform, addressing a fundamental challenge due to edge dependencies in such networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most studies assume uniform node distribution in random geometric graphs, but real-world networks often have non-uniform distributions with different properties. There's a need to statistically test whether a given network's node distribution is uniform.

Method: The authors develop a hypothesis testing framework using the asymptotic theory of degenerate U-statistics with kernel functions dependent on node count. They also provide an efficient method to compute the test statistic directly from the adjacency matrix.

Result: Under the null hypothesis (uniform distribution), the test statistic converges to standard normal distribution. The test shows high power in simulations and is validated through real data applications.

Conclusion: The proposed statistical test successfully addresses the challenging problem of testing node distribution uniformity in random geometric graphs, providing a practical tool for network analysis with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: Random geometric graphs are widely used in modeling geometry and dependence
structure in networks. In a random geometric graph, nodes are independently
generated from some probability distribution $F$ over a metric space, and edges
link nodes if their distance is less than some threshold. Most studies assume
the distribution $F$ to be uniform. However, recent research shows that some
real-world networks may be better modeled by nonuniform distribution $F$.
Moreover, graphs with nonuniform $F$ have notably different properties from
graphs with uniform $F$. A fundamental question is: given a network from a
random geometric graph, is the distribution $F$ uniform or not? In this paper,
we approach this question through hypothesis testing. This problem is
particularly challenging due to the inherent dependencies among edges in random
geometric graphs, a property not present in classic random graphs. We propose
the first statistical test. Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic
converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution. The asymptotic
distribution is derived using the asymptotic theory of degenerate U-statistics
with a kernel function dependent on the number of nodes. This technique is
different from existing methods in network hypothesis testing problems. In
addition, we present a method for efficiently calculating the test statistic
directly from the adjacency matrix. We also analytically characterize the power
of the proposed test. The simulation study shows that the proposed uniformity
test has high power. Real data applications are also provided.

*Mei Dong,Lin Liu,Dingke Tang,Geoffrey Liu,Wei Xu,Linbo Wang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A new framework for identifying average treatment effects with continuous instrumental variables using conditional weighted average derivative effects and a conditional Riesz representer, unifying continuous and categorical IVs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for continuous IVs impose strong parametric models or assume homogeneous treatment effects, while fully nonparametric methods perform poorly in moderate- to high-dimensional settings.

Method: Proposes a framework using conditional weighted average derivative effects with a conditional Riesz representer, characterizing the tangent space via second-order parametric submodel construction, and developing a locally efficient, triply robust estimator.

Result: Developed a locally efficient, triply robust, bounded, and easy-to-implement estimator that handles continuous IVs effectively.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies continuous and categorical IVs and provides practical estimation methods, demonstrated through application to assess the obesity paradox in oncology using clinical data from Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.

Abstract: Instrumental variables (IVs) are often continuous, arising in diverse fields
such as economics, epidemiology, and the social sciences. Existing approaches
for continuous IVs typically impose strong parametric models or assume
homogeneous treatment effects, while fully nonparametric methods may perform
poorly in moderate- to high-dimensional covariate settings. We propose a new
framework for identifying the average treatment effect with continuous IVs via
conditional weighted average derivative effects. Using a conditional Riesz
representer, our framework unifies continuous and categorical IVs. In this
framework, the average treatment effect is typically overidentified, leading to
a semiparametric observed-data model with a nontrivial tangent space.
Characterizing this tangent space involves a delicate construction of a
second-order parametric submodel, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not
been standard practice in this literature. For estimation, building on an
influence function in the semiparametric model that is also locally efficient
within a submodel, we develop a locally efficient, triply robust, bounded, and
easy-to-implement estimator. We apply our methods to an observational clinical
study from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre to examine the so-called obesity
paradox in oncology, assessing the causal effect of excess body weight on
two-year mortality among patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

### [100] [ROC Analysis with Covariate Adjustment Using Neural Network Models: Evaluating the Role of Age in the Physical Activity-Mortality Association](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14494)
*Ziad Akram Ali Hammouri,Yating Zhou,Rahul Ghosal,Juan C. Vidal,Marcos Matabuena*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: Proposes a neural network framework for covariate-adjusted ROC modeling to enable flexible nonlinear evaluation of biomarker effectiveness in discriminating between populations, with applications in physical activity biomarker assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ROC curves are limited for individual biomarker evaluation, and machine learning approaches have been underutilized despite their potential for more sophisticated biomarker assessment methods.

Method: Developed a neural network-based framework for covariate-adjusted ROC modeling that allows flexible nonlinear evaluation of biomarker discrimination effectiveness between two reference populations.

Result: Simulation tests showed good finite-sample performance under various dependency structures. Clinical case study revealed distinct covariate effects on mortality outcomes when assessing physical activity (TAC) as a biomarker, with stratification by sex and adjustment for age and BMI.

Conclusion: Covariate-adjusted modeling is crucial for biomarker evaluation, and TAC shows potential as a functional capacity biomarker when considering individual characteristics like sex, age, and BMI.

Abstract: The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and its summary measure,
the Area Under the Curve (AUC), are well-established tools for evaluating the
efficacy of biomarkers in biomedical studies. Compared to the traditional ROC
curve, the covariate-adjusted ROC curve allows for individual evaluation of the
biomarker. However, the use of machine learning models has rarely been explored
in this context, despite their potential to develop more powerful and
sophisticated approaches for biomarker evaluation. The goal of this paper is to
propose a framework for neural network-based covariate-adjusted ROC modeling
that allows flexible and nonlinear evaluation of the effectiveness of a
biomarker to discriminate between two reference populations. The finite-sample
performance of our method is investigated through extensive simulation tests
under varying dependency structures between biomarkers, covariates, and
referenced populations. The methodology is further illustrated in a clinically
case study that assesses daily physical activity - measured as total activity
time (TAC), a proxy for daily step count-as a biomarker to predict mortality at
three, five and eight years. Analyzes stratified by sex and adjusted for age
and BMI reveal distinct covariate effects on mortality outcomes. These results
underscore the importance of covariate-adjusted modeling in biomarker
evaluation and highlight TAC's potential as a functional capacity biomarker
based on specific individual characteristics.

### [101] [Additive Density Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14502)
*Eva-Maria Maier,Alexander Fottner,Sonja Greven,Almond Stöcker*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper presents a structured additive regression approach for modeling conditional densities when only distribution samples are observed, using Bayes Hilbert spaces to handle continuous, discrete, and mixed densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a regression framework that can model conditional distributions of mixed-type variables (with both continuous and discrete components) when only samples from these distributions are available, motivated by real-world economic data analysis.

Method: Uses structured additive regression in Bayes Hilbert spaces with respect to arbitrary finite measures, and proposes penalized maximum likelihood estimation via multinomial/Poisson regression approximation.

Result: Provides theoretical guarantees including asymptotic existence, uniqueness, consistency, and normality of estimators, plus confidence regions and inference for effect densities. Applied to gender economic data from SOEP.

Conclusion: The framework successfully models mixed-type conditional densities and provides rigorous statistical inference, demonstrated through analysis of women's income share distributions with discrete point masses at boundaries.

Abstract: We present a structured additive regression approach to model conditional
densities given scalar covariates, where only samples of the conditional
distributions are observed. This links our approach to distributional
regression models for scalar data. The model is formulated in a Bayes Hilbert
space -- preserving nonnegativity and integration to one under summation and
scalar multiplication -- with respect to an arbitrary finite measure. This
allows to consider, amongst others, continuous, discrete and mixed densities.
Our theoretical results include asymptotic existence, uniqueness, consistency,
and asymptotic normality of the penalized maximum likelihood estimator, as well
as confidence regions and inference for the (effect) densities. For estimation,
we propose to maximize the penalized log-likelihood corresponding to an
appropriate multinomial, or equivalently, Poisson regression model, which we
show to approximate the original penalized maximum likelihood problem. We apply
our framework to a motivating gender economic data set from the German
Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), analyzing the distribution of the woman's
share in a couple's total labor income given covariate effects for year, place
of residence and age of the youngest child. As the income share is a continuous
variable having discrete point masses at zero and one for single-earner
couples, the corresponding densities are of mixed type.

### [102] [Reframing cross-world independence for identifying path-specific effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14559)
*En-Yu Lai,Jih-Chang Yu,Yen-Tsung Huang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper analyzes three approaches to path-specific effects in multi-mediator models: classical (mediator-driven), interventional (randomized contrasts), and separable effects (component-specific actions). It generalizes separable effects beyond competing risks and unifies the approaches by clarifying their different interpretations of counterfactuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To relax the demanding cross-world independence assumption required for identifying path-specific effects in multi-mediator models, and to provide a more practical approach for applied mediation analysis in complex causal systems.

Method: The study uses SWIGs (Single World Intervention Graphs) to dissect causal foundations of three semantics: classical PSEs, interventional PSEs, and separable effects. It generalizes separable effects to multi-mediator models and unifies the approaches by clarifying their different interpretations of counterfactual outcomes.

Result: The paper demonstrates that violations of cross-world independence originate from omitted mediators, and argues that just as exchangeability is achieved by conditioning on sufficient confounders, cross-world independence can be approximated by including sufficient mediators. This reframes an abstract assumption into a tangible modeling strategy.

Conclusion: By reframing cross-world independence as a mediator inclusion problem analogous to confounder control, the paper offers a more practical path forward for applied mediation analysis in complex causal systems, turning an abstract assumption into a tangible modeling strategy.

Abstract: Understanding causal mechanisms in complex systems requires evaluating
path-specific effects (PSEs) in multi-mediator models. Identification of PSEs
traditionally relies on the demanding cross-world independence assumption. To
relax this, VanderWeele et al. (2014) proposed an interventional approach that
redefines PSEs, while Stensrud et al. (2021) introduced dismissible component
conditions for identifying separable effects under competing risks. In this
study, we leverage SWIGs to dissect the causal foundations of these three
semantics and make two key advances. First, we generalize separable effects
beyond competing risks to the setting of multi-mediator models and derive the
assumptions required for their identification. Second, we unify the three
approaches by clarifying how they interpret counterfactual outcomes
differently: as mediator-driven effects (classical), randomized contrasts
(interventional), or component-specific actions (separable). We further
demonstrate that violations of cross-world independence originate from
mediators omitted from the model. By analogy to confounder control, we argue
that just as exchangeability is achieved by conditioning on sufficient
confounders, cross-world independence can be approximated by including
sufficient mediators. This reframing turns an abstract assumption into a
tangible modeling strategy, offering a more practical path forward for applied
mediation analysis in complex causal systems.

*David L. Carl,Simone A. Padoan,Stefano Rizzelli*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework using Generalized Pareto distribution for modeling tail risks in serially dependent time series data, providing asymptotically honest credible regions for tail quantiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately quantifying tail risks (rare but high-impact events) in serially dependent data is a central challenge in risk management, particularly for financial crashes and extreme weather events.

Method: Developed a Bayesian framework based on Generalized Pareto distribution for modeling threshold exceedances in time series. Considers two cases: stationary marginal distribution under beta-mixing dependence, and dynamic tail quantiles in heteroscedastic regression models. Uses likelihood theory under serial dependence with local and global bounds for empirical log-likelihood process.

Result: The method yields asymptotically honest credible regions with coverage probabilities converging to nominal levels. Simulations show Bayesian credible regions outperform naive Bayesian and MLE-based confidence regions across ARMA, GARCH, and Markovian copula models. Real-data applications to U.S. interest rates and Swiss electricity demand demonstrate practical relevance.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian framework provides reliable quantification of tail risks in serially dependent time series, with theoretical guarantees and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying tail risks-rare but high-impact events such as
financial crashes or extreme weather-is a central challenge in risk management,
with serially dependent data. We develop a Bayesian framework based on the
Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution for modeling threshold exceedances,
providing posterior distributions for the GP parameters and tail quantiles in
time series. Two cases are considered: extrapolation of tail quantiles for the
stationary marginal distribution under beta-mixing dependence, and dynamic,
past-conditional tail quantiles in heteroscedastic regression models. The
proposal yields asymptotically honest credible regions, whose coverage
probabilities converge to their nominal levels. We establish the asymptotic
theory for the Bayesian procedure, deriving conditions on the prior
distributions under which the posterior satisfies key asymptotic properties. To
achieve this, we first develop a likelihood theory under serial dependence,
providing local and global bounds for the empirical log-likelihood process of
the misspecified GP model and deriving corresponding asymptotic properties of
the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). Simulations demonstrate that our
Bayesian credible regions outperform naive Bayesian and MLE-based confidence
regions across several standard time series models, including ARMA, GARCH, and
Markovian copula models. Two real-data applications-to U.S. interest rates and
Swiss electricity demand-highlight the relevance of the proposed methodology.

### [104] [Hierarchical shot-noise Cox process mixtures for clustering across groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14681)
*Alessandro Carminati,Mario Beraha,Federico Camerlenghi,Alessandra Guglielmi*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces the hierarchical shot-noise Cox process (HSNCP) mixture model to address limitations in existing Bayesian nonparametric clustering methods, particularly overcoming the trade-off between clustering accuracy and density estimation across partially exchangeable groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for clustering across partially exchangeable groups use exact atom sharing in mixing measures, which can be overly rigid when groups differ subtly. This creates a trade-off between clustering performance and density estimation quality, especially at larger sample sizes where clusters may fragment.

Method: The authors propose the hierarchical shot-noise Cox process (HSNCP) mixture model, where group-specific atoms concentrate around shared centers through a kernel. This enables flexible borrowing across groups while maintaining accurate density estimation within groups. The model is built on the shot-noise Cox process framework and remains analytically tractable.

Result: The HSNCP model demonstrates balanced across-group clustering and improved density estimates compared to the hierarchical Dirichlet process, including under model misspecification. The authors develop closed-form prior moments, inter-group correlation measures, and an efficient conditional MCMC algorithm for posterior inference.

Conclusion: The HSNCP mixture model successfully overcomes the density-clustering trade-off present in previous approaches, providing both accurate density estimation within groups and flexible borrowing across groups, as validated through simulations and application to a large galaxy dataset.

Abstract: Clustering observations across partially exchangeable groups of data is a
routine task in Bayesian nonparametrics. Previously proposed models allow for
clustering across groups by sharing atoms in the group-specific mixing
measures. However, exact atom sharing can be overly rigid when groups differ
subtly, introducing a trade-off between clustering and density estimates and
fragmenting across-group clusters, particularly at larger sample sizes. We
introduce the hierarchical shot-noise Cox process (HSNCP) mixture model, where
group-specific atoms concentrate around shared centers through a kernel. This
enables accurate density estimation within groups and flexible borrowing across
groups, overcoming the density-clustering trade-off of previous approaches. Our
construction, built on the shot-noise Cox process, remains analytically
tractable: we derive closed-form prior moments and an inter-group correlation,
obtain the marginal law and predictive distribution for latent parameters, as
well as the posterior of the mixing measures given the latent parameters. We
develop an efficient conditional MCMC algorithm for posterior inference. We
assess the performance of the HSNCP model through simulations and an
application to a large galaxy dataset, demonstrating balanced across-group
clusters and improved density estimates compared with the hierarchical
Dirichlet process, including under model misspecification.

### [106] [Loss functions arising from the index of agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14714)
*Hristos Tyralis,Georgia Papacharalampous*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the theoretical properties of Willmott's index of agreement loss function and proposes an improved version that maintains desirable properties while enabling closed-form solutions for linear models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address theoretical limitations in Willmott's index of agreement, a widely used metric in environmental sciences and engineering, and to develop an improved loss function with better geometric alignment and computational advantages.

Method: Theoretical analysis of L_W properties, proposal of L_NR_2 as an improved loss function with modified denominator using sum of Euclidean distances, and comparative analysis with squared error loss.

Result: L_W is bounded, translation and scale invariant, and estimates specific distribution parameters. L_NR_2 retains these properties while admitting closed-form solutions for linear models. All three loss functions converge when predictor correlation approaches 1.

Conclusion: The proposed L_NR_2 loss function provides theoretical improvements over L_W while maintaining its appealing properties, with practical implications for hydrologic model calibration and potential enhancements for existing L_p-norm variants.

Abstract: We examine the theoretical properties of the index of agreement loss function
$L_W$, the negatively oriented counterpart of Willmott's index of agreement, a
common metric in environmental sciences and engineering. We prove that $L_W$ is
bounded within [0, 1], translation and scale invariant, and estimates the
parameter $\Bbb{E}_{F}[\underline{y}] \pm \Bbb{V}_{F}^{1/2}[\underline{y}]$
when fitting a distribution. We propose $L_{\operatorname{NR}_2}$ as a
theoretical improvement, which replaces the denominator of $L_W$ with the sum
of Euclidean distances, better aligning with the underlying geometric
intuition. This new loss function retains the appealing properties of $L_W$ but
also admits closed-form solutions for linear model parameter estimation. We
show that as the correlation between predictors and the dependent variable
approaches 1, parameter estimates from squared error, $L_{\operatorname{NR}_2}$
and $L_W$ converge. This behavior is mirrored in hydrologic model calibration
(a core task in water resources engineering), where performance becomes nearly
identical across these loss functions. Finally, we suggest potential
improvements for existing $L_p$-norm variants of the index of agreement.

TL;DR: Two EM algorithms for estimating prior distributions in mixture linear regression models: one for kernelized NPMLE (handles continuous/discrete priors) and one for approximating NPMLE with density priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient methods for estimating prior distributions of regression coefficients in mixture linear regression models, addressing both continuous and discrete distribution cases.

Method: Proposed two EM algorithms: 1) kernelized NPMLE for continuous priors and cluster number estimation, 2) NPMLE approximation for density priors with post-processing for discrete cases.

Result: Both algorithms show good convergence properties and effectiveness in simulations and real data applications, accurately recovering continuous distributions and estimating cluster numbers.

Conclusion: The proposed EM algorithms provide effective tools for prior distribution estimation in mixture linear regression models, handling both continuous and discrete distribution scenarios with good performance.

Abstract: In a mixture of linear regression model, the regression coefficients are
treated as random vectors that may follow either a continuous or discrete
distribution. We propose two Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms to
estimate this prior distribution. The first algorithm solves a kernelized
version of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation (NPMLE). This method
not only recovers continuous prior distributions but also accurately estimates
the number of clusters when the prior is discrete. The second algorithm,
designed to approximate the NPMLE, targets prior distributions with a density.
It also performs well for discrete priors when combined with a post-processing
step. We study the convergence properties of both algorithms and demonstrate
their effectiveness through simulations and applications to real datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model misspecification of formative indicators is a widespread problem in academic literature, with no clear consensus on practical approaches. Researchers currently rely on psychometric frameworks designed for reflective models, leading to misleading findings.

Method: The framework is developed through exhaustive literature review and integrates essential pilot diagnostics including descriptive statistics and multicollinearity checks. It provides theoretical and structural clarity for appropriate validation techniques.

Result: The proposed methodology enables researchers to justify and adhere to validation techniques that accurately account for the causal nature of formative constructs while maintaining high psychometric and statistical integrity.

Conclusion: This framework offers a pragmatic, prescriptive approach to manage the gap in formative construct validation, providing researchers with the necessary tools to avoid model misspecification and ensure accurate findings.

Abstract: Model misspecification of formative indicators remains a widely documented
issue across academic literature, yet scholars lack a clear consensus on
pragmatic, prescriptive approaches to manage this gap. This ambiguity forces
researchers to rely on psychometric frameworks primarily intended for
reflective models, and thus risks misleading findings. This article introduces
a Multi-Step Validation Methodology Framework specifically designed for
formative constructs in survey-based research. The proposed framework is
grounded in an exhaustive literature review and integrates essential pilot
diagnostics through descriptive statistics and multicollinearity checks. The
methodology provides researchers with the necessary theoretical and structural
clarity to finally justify and adhere to appropriate validation techniques that
accurately account for the causal nature of the constructs while ensuring high

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework for analyzing SGD dynamics in high-dimensional optimization with multi-class anisotropic data, revealing structural phase transitions in how SGD aligns with data covariance structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how stochastic gradient descent behaves in high-dimensional settings with complex data structures, particularly when dealing with multiple classes and anisotropic covariance matrices.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework using deterministic ODE systems to analyze SGD dynamics, applied to Gaussian-mixture data with multiple classes. Studied three covariance structures: isotropic, zero-one model, and power-law spectra.

Result: Discovered structural phase transitions where SGD aligns more with 'clean directions' (smaller variance) in anisotropic covariances. Both numerical simulations and analytical studies confirm the asymptotic behavior of loss in high-dimensional limits.

Conclusion: SGD exhibits distinct alignment behaviors depending on data covariance structure, with preferential alignment towards directions of smaller variance in anisotropic settings, revealing fundamental phase transitions in high-dimensional optimization dynamics.

Abstract: We develop a framework for analyzing the training and learning rate dynamics
on a variety of high- dimensional optimization problems trained using one-pass
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with data generated from multiple anisotropic
classes. We give exact expressions for a large class of functions of the
limiting dynamics, including the risk and the overlap with the true signal, in
terms of a deterministic solution to a system of ODEs. We extend the existing
theory of high-dimensional SGD dynamics to Gaussian-mixture data and a large
(growing with the parameter size) number of classes. We then investigate in
detail the effect of the anisotropic structure of the covariance of the data in
the problems of binary logistic regression and least square loss. We study
three cases: isotropic covariances, data covariance matrices with a large
fraction of zero eigenvalues (denoted as the zero-one model), and covariance
matrices with spectra following a power-law distribution. We show that there
exists a structural phase transition. In particular, we demonstrate that, for
the zero-one model and the power-law model with sufficiently large power, SGD
tends to align more closely with values of the class mean that are projected
onto the "clean directions" (i.e., directions of smaller variance). This is
supported by both numerical simulations and analytical studies, which show the
exact asymptotic behavior of the loss in the high-dimensional limit.

TL;DR: A hybrid deforestation detection pipeline combining optical and SAR data using anomaly detection via KL expansion and Hidden Markov Models, achieving high accuracy and robustness in cloudy regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust deforestation detection method that works effectively in cloudy regions where optical data is often sparse, overcoming limitations of traditional parametric methods that require prior knowledge of data distribution.

Method: Combines optical anomaly maps (created using discrete KL expansion residuals with concentration bounds) with SAR data, then classifies forest state using Hidden Markov Models. Tested with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.

Result: Both hybrid optical-radar and optical-only methods achieved high accuracy superior to recent state-of-the-art hybrid methods. The hybrid method showed significantly better robustness with sparse optical data common in cloudy regions.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach effectively combines optical and SAR data for deforestation detection, providing high accuracy and improved robustness in challenging environmental conditions with sparse optical data.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a deforestation detection pipeline that incorporates
optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. A crucial component of the
pipeline is the construction of anomaly maps of the optical data, which is done
using the residual space of a discrete Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) expansion.
Anomalies are quantified using a concentration bound on the distribution of the
residual components for the nominal state of the forest. This bound does not
require prior knowledge on the distribution of the data. This is in contrast to
statistical parametric methods that assume knowledge of the data distribution,
an impractical assumption that is especially infeasible for high dimensional
data such as ours. Once the optical anomaly maps are computed they are combined
with SAR data, and the state of the forest is classified by using a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM). We test our approach with Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2
(Optical) data on a $92.19\,km \times 91.80\,km$ region in the Amazon forest.
The results show that both the hybrid optical-radar and optical only methods
achieve high accuracy that is superior to the recent state-of-the-art hybrid
method. Moreover, the hybrid method is significantly more robust in the case of
sparse optical data that are common in highly cloudy regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering validation indices degrade in high-dimensional or contaminated data due to their dependence on centroid-based distances, creating a need for robust alternatives.

Method: Extends BWDM criterion with random projection and PCA for dimensionality reduction, combined with trimmed clustering and medoid-based distances for outlier robustness.

Result: HD-BWDM demonstrates stability and interpretability under high-dimensional projections and contamination, outperforming traditional centroid-based validation criteria.

Conclusion: HD-BWDM provides a theoretically grounded, computationally efficient stopping rule for nonparametric clustering in high-dimensional applications with theoretical consistency guarantees.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate number of clusters in unsupervised learning is a
central problem in statistics and data science. Traditional validity indices
such as Calinski-Harabasz, Silhouette, and Davies-Bouldin-depend on
centroid-based distances and therefore degrade in high-dimensional or
contaminated data. This paper proposes a new robust, nonparametric clustering
validation framework, the High-Dimensional Between-Within Distance Median
(HD-BWDM), which extends the recently introduced BWDM criterion to
high-dimensional spaces. HD-BWDM integrates random projection and principal
component analysis to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and applies trimmed
clustering and medoid-based distances to ensure robustness against outliers. We
derive theoretical results showing consistency and convergence under
Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings. Extensive simulations demonstrate that
HD-BWDM remains stable and interpretable under high-dimensional projections and
contamination, providing a robust alternative to traditional centroid-based
validation criteria. The proposed method provides a theoretically grounded,
computationally efficient stopping rule for nonparametric clustering in modern
high-dimensional applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating learned regressors remains challenging without access to the true data-generating mechanism, as no existing data-driven assessment method can ensure achievability of global optimality.

Method: The Information Teacher framework builds on estimating Shannon mutual information between input variables and residuals, applying to a broad class of additive noise models.

Result: Numerical experiments confirm that the Information Teacher is capable of detecting global optimality, which aligns with zero estimation error relative to the true model, working as a surrogate measure of ground truth assessment loss.

Conclusion: The Information Teacher offers a principled alternative to conventional empirical performance metrics with formal performance guarantees for assessing regression algorithm quality.

Abstract: In Machine Learning (ML), a regression algorithm aims to minimize a loss
function based on data. An assessment method in this context seeks to quantify
the discrepancy between the optimal response for an input-output system and the
estimate produced by a learned predictive model (the student). Evaluating the
quality of a learned regressor remains challenging without access to the true
data-generating mechanism, as no data-driven assessment method can ensure the
achievability of global optimality. This work introduces the Information
Teacher, a novel data-driven framework for evaluating regression algorithms
with formal performance guarantees to assess global optimality. Our novel
approach builds on estimating the Shannon mutual information (MI) between the
input variables and the residuals and applies to a broad class of additive
noise models. Through numerical experiments, we confirm that the Information
Teacher is capable of detecting global optimality, which is aligned with the
condition of zero estimation error with respect to the -- inaccessible, in
practice -- true model, working as a surrogate measure of the ground truth
assessment loss and offering a principled alternative to conventional empirical
performance metrics.

Motivation: Existing personalized federated learning methods have limitations: entry-wise penalties ignore cross-response dependence, while matrix-wise fusion over-couples clients. There's a need for a method that effectively handles heterogeneous client models while sharing variable-level structure.

Method: Developed RowFed algorithm with SROF regularizer that clusters row vectors across clients and induces within-row sparsity, embedded in a linearized ADMM framework with privacy-preserving partial participation.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows oracle property for SROF with correct variable-level group recovery and asymptotic normality. RowFed converges to stationary solution with iterate gap contraction rate improving with participation probability. Empirical results show lower estimation/prediction error and better variable-level cluster recovery compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Row-wise fusion is an effective and transparent paradigm for large-scale personalized federated multivariate learning, bridging the gap between entry-wise and matrix-wise formulations while preserving interpretability.

Abstract: We study personalized federated learning for multivariate responses where
client models are heterogeneous yet share variable-level structure. Existing
entry-wise penalties ignore cross-response dependence, while matrix-wise fusion
over-couples clients. We propose a Sparse Row-wise Fusion (SROF) regularizer
that clusters row vectors across clients and induces within-row sparsity, and
we develop RowFed, a communication-efficient federated algorithm that embeds
SROF into a linearized ADMM framework with privacy-preserving partial
participation. Theoretically, we establish an oracle property for
SROF-achieving correct variable-level group recovery with asymptotic
normality-and prove convergence of RowFed to a stationary solution. Under
random client participation, the iterate gap contracts at a rate that improves
with participation probability. Empirically, simulations in heterogeneous
regimes show that RowFed consistently lowers estimation and prediction error
and strengthens variable-level cluster recovery over NonFed, FedAvg, and a
personalized matrix-fusion baseline. A real-data study further corroborates
these gains while preserving interpretability. Together, our results position
row-wise fusion as an effective and transparent paradigm for large-scale
personalized federated multivariate learning, bridging the gap between
entry-wise and matrix-wise formulations.

### [114] [Local Causal Discovery for Statistically Efficient Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14582)
*Mátyás Schubert,Tom Claassen,Sara Magliacane*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: LOAD is a causal discovery method that combines the scalability of local methods with the statistical optimality of global methods for finding optimal adjustment sets in causal effect estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global causal discovery methods become computationally prohibitive with many variables, while local methods are scalable but find suboptimal adjustment sets. There's a need for a method that achieves both computational efficiency and statistical optimality.

Method: LOAD first identifies causal relations between targets using local information and tests effect identifiability. If identifiable, it finds optimal adjustment sets by inferring mediators and their parents through local causal discovery. Otherwise, it returns locally valid parent adjustment sets.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and realistic data show LOAD outperforms global methods in scalability while providing more accurate effect estimation than local methods.

Conclusion: LOAD successfully bridges the gap between computational efficiency and statistical optimality in causal discovery, offering a practical solution for causal effect estimation.

Abstract: Causal discovery methods can identify valid adjustment sets for causal effect
estimation for a pair of target variables, even when the underlying causal
graph is unknown. Global causal discovery methods focus on learning the whole
causal graph and therefore enable the recovery of optimal adjustment sets,
i.e., sets with the lowest asymptotic variance, but they quickly become
computationally prohibitive as the number of variables grows. Local causal
discovery methods offer a more scalable alternative by focusing on the local
neighborhood of the target variables, but are restricted to statistically
suboptimal adjustment sets. In this work, we propose Local Optimal Adjustments
Discovery (LOAD), a sound and complete causal discovery approach that combines
the computational efficiency of local methods with the statistical optimality
of global methods. First, LOAD identifies the causal relation between the
targets and tests if the causal effect is identifiable by using only local
information. If it is identifiable, it then finds the optimal adjustment set by
leveraging local causal discovery to infer the mediators and their parents.
Otherwise, it returns the locally valid parent adjustment sets based on the
learned local structure. In our experiments on synthetic and realistic data
LOAD outperforms global methods in scalability, while providing more accurate
effect estimation than local methods.

*Zhikun Zhang,Guanyu Pan,Xiangjun Wang,Yong Xu,Guangtao Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel computational framework combining physics-informed deep learning with Bayesian inference for parameter identification in PDEs with discontinuous coefficients, using dual-network architecture and gradient-adaptive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical and machine learning approaches struggle with inverse problems in PDEs having discontinuous coefficients due to high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and discontinuous parameter spaces.

Method: Dual-network architecture with gradient-adaptive weighting: main network approximates PDE solutions, sub-network samples coefficients. Uses Markovian dynamics methods to capture hidden state transitions and identify mixture structures in parameter spaces.

Result: Comprehensive numerical experiments show exceptional adaptability, accuracy, and robustness in reconstructing solutions and identifying parameter-varying regions for various PDEs with jump-varying coefficients.

Conclusion: Provides a generalizable computational approach for parameter identification in PDEs with discontinuous parameter structures, particularly useful for non-stationary or heterogeneous systems.

Abstract: Inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) with
discontinuous coefficients are fundamental challenges in modeling complex
spatiotemporal systems with heterogeneous structures and uncertain dynamics.
Traditional numerical and machine learning approaches often face limitations in
addressing these problems due to high dimensionality, inherent nonlinearity,
and discontinuous parameter spaces. In this work, we propose a novel
computational framework that synergistically integrates physics-informed deep
learning with Bayesian inference for accurate parameter identification in PDEs
with jump discontinuities in coefficients. The core innovation of our framework
lies in a dual-network architecture employing a gradient-adaptive weighting
strategy: a main network approximates PDE solutions while a sub network samples
its coefficients. To effectively identify mixture structures in parameter
spaces, we employ Markovian dynamics methods to capture hidden state
transitions of complex spatiotemporal systems. The framework has applications
in reconstruction of solutions and identification of parameter-varying regions.
Comprehensive numerical experiments on various PDEs with jump-varying
coefficients demonstrate the framework's exceptional adaptability, accuracy,
and robustness compared to existing methods. This study provides a
generalizable computational approach of parameter identification for PDEs with
discontinuous parameter structures, particularly in non-stationary or
heterogeneous systems.

*Pierre Glaser,David Widmann,Fredrik Lindsten,Arthur Gretton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The KCCSD test is a non-parametric, kernel-based method for assessing probabilistic model calibration using score functions, avoiding expensive expectation approximations while controlling type-I error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient calibration test that doesn't require costly expectation approximations and provides statistical guarantees on type-I error control.

Method: Uses a new family of kernels for score-based probabilities that can be estimated without probability density samples, combined with a conditional goodness-of-fit criterion for the test's U-statistic.

Result: The test demonstrates its properties across various synthetic settings, showing it can effectively assess model calibration.

Conclusion: The KCCSD test provides an efficient, kernel-based approach for probabilistic model calibration assessment with controlled type-I error, overcoming limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: We introduce the Kernel Calibration Conditional Stein Discrepancy test (KCCSD
test), a non-parametric, kernel-based test for assessing the calibration of
probabilistic models with well-defined scores. In contrast to previous methods,
our test avoids the need for possibly expensive expectation approximations
while providing control over its type-I error. We achieve these improvements by
using a new family of kernels for score-based probabilities that can be
estimated without probability density samples, and by using a conditional
goodness-of-fit criterion for the KCCSD test's U-statistic. We demonstrate the
properties of our test on various synthetic settings.

*Gavin Kerrigan,Christian A. Naesseth,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel geometric framework for optimal experimental design using mutual transport dependence (MTD) based on optimal transport theory, offering flexible geometry choices for specific estimation problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional OED approaches based on mutual information have restrictive invariance properties and rely on probability densities, limiting their flexibility and applicability.

Method: Propose mutual transport dependence (MTD) grounded in optimal transport theory, which provides a geometric objective for optimizing designs that can be tailored to specific downstream estimation problems by choosing appropriate geometries.

Result: The framework produces high-quality designs and offers a flexible alternative to standard information-theoretic techniques.

Conclusion: The MTD-based geometric framework addresses limitations of traditional OED approaches and provides a more flexible, geometry-aware method for experimental design optimization.

Abstract: We introduce a novel geometric framework for optimal experimental design
(OED). Traditional OED approaches, such as those based on mutual information,
rely explicitly on probability densities, leading to restrictive invariance
properties. To address these limitations, we propose the mutual transport
dependence (MTD), a measure of statistical dependence grounded in optimal
transport theory which provides a geometric objective for optimizing designs.
Unlike conventional approaches, the MTD can be tailored to specific downstream
estimation problems by choosing appropriate geometries on the underlying
spaces. We demonstrate that our framework produces high-quality designs while
offering a flexible alternative to standard information-theoretic techniques.
