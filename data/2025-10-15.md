### [1] [Contrastive Dimension Reduction: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11847)
*Sam Hawke,Eric Zhang,Jiawen Chen,Didong Li*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper provides a systematic review of contrastive dimension reduction (CDR) methods that extract signal unique to treatment groups relative to control groups, proposing a unified framework and taxonomy for existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dimension reduction techniques like PCA often fail to isolate specific signals of interest in case-control studies across domains like genomics, imaging, and time series analysis, necessitating specialized CDR methods.

Method: The authors propose a systematic pipeline for analyzing case-control studies and develop a taxonomy of CDR methods based on their assumptions, objectives, and mathematical formulations to unify disparate approaches under a shared conceptual framework.

Result: The review highlights key applications and challenges in existing CDR methods, providing a clear framework that facilitates broader adoption and identifies open questions for future research.

Conclusion: By establishing a unified conceptual framework for contrastive dimension reduction, this review aims to promote wider adoption of CDR methods and stimulate further developments in this emerging field.

Abstract: Contrastive dimension reduction (CDR) methods aim to extract signal unique to
or enriched in a treatment (foreground) group relative to a control
(background) group. This setting arises in many scientific domains, such as
genomics, imaging, and time series analysis, where traditional dimension
reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may fail to
isolate the signal of interest. In this review, we provide a systematic
overview of existing CDR methods. We propose a pipeline for analyzing
case-control studies together with a taxonomy of CDR methods based on their
assumptions, objectives, and mathematical formulations, unifying disparate
approaches under a shared conceptual framework. We highlight key applications
and challenges in existing CDR methods, and identify open questions and future
directions. By providing a clear framework for CDR and its applications, we aim
to facilitate broader adoption and motivate further developments in this
emerging field.

### [2] [Monitoring 3D Lattice Structures in Additive Manufacturing Using Topological Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11740)
*Yulin An,Xueqi Zhao,Enrique del Castillo*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A new statistical process control method for lattice structures using Topological Data Analysis and persistent homology to detect topological anomalies in complex geometries like aerospace components and biomedical implants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applications in additive manufacturing where hollow lattice geometries are critical, such as aerospace components and biomedical implants, require monitoring of structural topology.

Method: Monitoring persistent homology properties (dimensions zero and one for connected components and loops) using nonparametric hypothesis testing and control charting schemes.

Result: Extensive run-length analysis via simulated lattice-structured parts demonstrates that persistent homology effectively detects topological anomalies in complex geometries.

Conclusion: Persistent homology provides a robust, intrinsically geometrical alternative to other SPC methods for mesh and point data in monitoring lattice structures.

Abstract: We present a new method for the statistical process control of lattice
structures using tools from Topological Data Analysis. Motivated by
applications in additive manufacturing, such as aerospace components and
biomedical implants, where hollow lattice geometries are critical, the proposed
framework is based on monitoring the persistent homology properties of parts.
Specifically, we focus on homological features of dimensions zero and one,
corresponding to connected components and one-dimensional loops, to
characterize and detect changes in the topology of lattice structures. A
nonparametric hypothesis testing procedure and a control charting scheme are
introduced to monitor these features during production. Furthermore, we conduct
extensive run-length analysis via various simulated but real-life
lattice-structured parts. Our results demonstrate that persistent homology is
well-suited for detecting topological anomalies in complex geometries and
offers a robust, intrinsically geometrical alternative to other SPC methods for
mesh and point data.

### [3] [A Martingale Kernel Two-Sample Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11853)
*Anirban Chatterjee,Aaditya Ramdas*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes martingale MMD (mMMD), a quadratic-time statistic for two-sample testing that has a limiting standard Gaussian distribution under the null, offering computational savings over standard MMD tests with minor power loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard MMD test statistic has an intractable null distribution requiring costly resampling or permutation approaches for calibration, which motivates the development of a more computationally efficient alternative.

Method: Leverage a martingale interpretation of the estimated squared MMD to propose martingale MMD (mMMD), a quadratic-time statistic that converges to a standard Gaussian distribution under the null hypothesis.

Result: The mMMD test is consistent against any fixed alternative and offers substantial computational savings over the standard MMD test for large sample sizes, with only a minor loss in power.

Conclusion: Martingale MMD provides an efficient alternative to standard MMD testing by eliminating the need for resampling while maintaining good statistical properties and computational advantages.

Abstract: The Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a widely used multivariate distance
metric for two-sample testing. The standard MMD test statistic has an
intractable null distribution typically requiring costly resampling or
permutation approaches for calibration. In this work we leverage a martingale
interpretation of the estimated squared MMD to propose martingale MMD (mMMD), a
quadratic-time statistic which has a limiting standard Gaussian distribution
under the null. Moreover we show that the test is consistent against any fixed
alternative and for large sample sizes, mMMD offers substantial computational
savings over the standard MMD test, with only a minor loss in power.

### [4] [Hypothesis testing for the dimension of random geometric graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11844)
*Mingao Yuan,Feng Yu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes the first statistical test for verifying the dimension parameter in random geometric graph models, with the test statistic converging to standard normal under the null hypothesis and being unbounded under the alternative hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random geometric graphs (RGGs) are effective for modeling real-world networks like protein-protein interactions, but there's uncertainty about whether the prespecified dimension parameter matches the true dimension, requiring a formal statistical test.

Method: The authors develop a hypothesis testing framework using degenerate U-statistics with kernel functions dependent on node count. They derive asymptotic distributions and propose an efficient computation method based on adjacency matrices.

Result: Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed test performs well. The test is also successfully applied to multiple real-world networks to validate their dimensions.

Conclusion: The paper presents the first statistical test for dimension verification in RGGs, providing a reliable method to ensure the accuracy of dimension parameters when fitting geometric graph models to real-world networks.

Abstract: Random geometric graphs (RGGs) offer a powerful tool for analyzing the
geometric and dependence structures in real-world networks. For example, it has
been observed that RGGs are a good model for protein-protein interaction
networks. In RGGs, nodes are randomly distributed over an $m$-dimensional
metric space, and edges connect the nodes if and only if their distance is less
than some threshold. When fitting RGGs to real-world networks, the first step
is probably to input or estimate the dimension $m$. However, it is not clear
whether the prespecified dimension is equal to the true dimension. In this
paper, we investigate this problem using hypothesis testing. Under the null
hypothesis, the dimension is equal to a specific value, while the alternative
hypothesis asserts the dimension is not equal to that value. We propose the
first statistical test. Under the null hypothesis, the proposed test statistic
converges in law to the standard normal distribution, and under the alternative
hypothesis, the test statistic is unbounded in probability. We derive the
asymptotic distribution by leveraging the asymptotic theory of degenerate
U-statistics with kernel function dependent on the number of nodes. This
approach differs significantly from prevailing methods used in network
hypothesis testing problems. Moreover, we also propose an efficient approach to
compute the test statistic based on the adjacency matrix. Simulation studies
show that the proposed test performs well. We also apply the proposed test to
multiple real-world networks to test their dimensions.

### [5] [Optimal Treatment Rules under Missing Predictive Covariates: A Covariate-Balancing Doubly Robust Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12321)
*Yue Zhang,Shanshan Luo,Zhi Geng,Yangbo He*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: Proposes a covariate-balancing doubly robust estimator for optimal individualized treatment rules that handles missing covariates and improves efficiency when additional predictive covariates are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In precision medicine, estimating optimal ITRs is crucial but complicated by missing covariates that may not be confounders. It's uncertain whether these missing covariates should be included for learning optimal ITRs, creating a need for robust methods.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Estimate propensity scores by solving covariate-balancing equation, 2) Minimize objective function to estimate outcome model, with function defined by asymptotic variance under correctly specified propensity score.

Result: Method achieves double robustness (consistent when either propensity score or outcome model is correct), minimizes variance within augmented inverse probability weighted estimators class, and improves efficiency when applied to partially observed outcome-related covariates.

Conclusion: The proposed covariate-balancing doubly robust estimator effectively handles missing covariates in ITR estimation, providing robust and efficient treatment recommendations validated through simulations and real-world datasets.

Abstract: In precision medicine, one of the most important problems is estimating the
optimal individualized treatment rules (ITR), which typically involves
recommending treatment decisions based on fully observed individual
characteristics of patients to maximize overall clinical benefit. In practice,
however, there may be missing covariates that are not necessarily confounders,
and it remains uncertain whether these missing covariates should be included
for learning optimal ITRs. In this paper, we propose a covariate-balancing
doubly robust estimator for constructing optimal ITRs, which is particularly
suitable for situations with additional predictive covariates. The proposed
method is based on two main steps: First, the propensity scores are estimated
by solving the covariate-balancing equation. Second, an objective function is
minimized to estimate the outcome model, with the function defined by the
asymptotic variance under the correctly specified propensity score. The method
has three significant advantages: (i) It is doubly robust, ensuring consistency
when either the propensity score or outcome model is correctly specified. (ii)
It minimizes variance within the class of augmented inverse probability
weighted estimators. (iii) When applied to partially observed covariates
related to the outcome, the method may further improve estimation efficiency.
We demonstrate the proposed method through extensive numerical simulations and
two real-world datasets.

### [6] [On the permutation invariance principle for causal estimands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11863)
*Jiaqi Tong,Fan Li*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces permutation invariance as a key principle for causal estimands when multiple action variables share the same causal role without natural ordering. It provides methods to verify this property and proposes weighted estimands that maintain invariance while capturing all-order interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many causal inference problems involve multiple action variables with identical causal roles but no natural ordering, creating ambiguity in interpretation. The authors aim to establish permutation invariance as a fundamental principle to ensure causal estimands remain consistent under relabeling of these variables.

Method: The authors formally characterize permutation invariance, analyze its algebraic and combinatorial structure for verification, and introduce a class of weighted estimands that are permutation-invariant. They provide guidance on selecting weights to achieve residual-free estimands and extend the approach to ratio effect measures.

Result: The paper presents weighted estimands that are permutation-invariant while capturing interactions of all orders. It also identifies conditions for selecting weights that yield residual-free estimands, where inclusion-exclusion sums capture the maximal effect.

Conclusion: Permutation invariance is established as a crucial principle for causal inference with multiple symmetric action variables. The proposed weighted estimands provide a systematic approach to maintain this invariance while comprehensively capturing causal effects and interactions.

Abstract: In many causal inference problems, multiple action variables share the same
causal role, such as mediators, factors, network units, or genotypes, yet lack
a natural ordering. To avoid ambiguity in interpretation, causal estimands
should remain unchanged under relabeling, an implicit principle we refer to as
permutation invariance. We formally characterize this principle, analyze its
algebraic and combinatorial structure for verification, and present a class of
weighted estimands that are permutation-invariant while capturing interactions
of all orders. We further provide guidance on selecting weights that yield
residual-free estimands, whose inclusion-exclusion sums capture the maximal
effect, and extend our results to ratio effect measures.

### [7] [Inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chains to infer flexible time-varying evolutionary rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11982)
*Pratyusa Datta,Philippe Lemey,Marc A. Suchard*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A Bayesian phylogenetic framework using inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chains to model time-varying evolutionary rates, parameterized as piecewise constant functions with Gaussian Markov random field priors for temporal smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconstruct evolutionary histories and estimate changing evolutionary rates from molecular sequence data, which is important for evolutionary biology and infectious disease research, addressing limitations of constant rate models.

Method: Uses inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chains (ICTMCs) with rate functions parameterized as piecewise constant (polyepoch clock model), employs Gaussian Markov random field priors for temporal smoothing, and implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling with scalable gradient evaluation.

Result: The framework successfully recovers true timescales and rates in simulations, and is applied to examine evolutionary rates of West Nile virus, Dengue virus, influenza A/H3N2, and SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe.

Conclusion: The polyepoch clock model provides a computationally efficient and flexible approach for estimating time-varying evolutionary rates, enabling more accurate reconstruction of evolutionary histories across various viral pathogens.

Abstract: Reconstructing evolutionary histories and estimating the rate of evolution
from molecular sequence data is of central importance in evolutionary biology
and infectious disease research. We introduce a flexible Bayesian phylogenetic
inference framework that accommodates changing evolutionary rates over time by
modeling sequence character substitution processes as inhomogeneous
continuous-time Markov chains (ICTMCs) acting along the unknown phylogeny,
where the rate remains as an unknown, positive and integrable function of time.
The integral of the rate function appears in the finite-time transition
probabilities of the ICTMCs that must be efficiently computed for all branches
of the phylogeny to evaluate the observed data likelihood. Circumventing
computational challenges that arise from a fully nonparametric function, we
successfully parameterize the rate function as piecewise constant with a large
number of epochs that we call the polyepoch clock model. This makes the
transition probability computation relatively inexpensive and continues to
flexibly capture rate change over time. We employ a Gaussian Markov random
field prior to achieve temporal smoothing of the estimated rate function.
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling enabled by scalable gradient evaluation under
this model makes our framework computationally efficient. We assess the
performance of the polyepoch clock model in recovering the true timescales and
rates through simulations under two different evolutionary scenarios. We then
apply the polyepoch clock model to examine the rates of West Nile virus, Dengue
virus and influenza A/H3N2 evolution, and estimate the time-varying rate of
SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe in 2020.

### [8] [Robust Functional Logistic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12048)
*Berkay Akturk,Ufuk Beyaztas,Han Lin Shang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: Proposes a robust estimation method for functional logistic regression that handles outliers in both functional predictors and binary response using robust functional principal component analysis and M-type estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing functional logistic regression methods are sensitive to outliers, leading to inaccurate parameter estimates and poor classification accuracy.

Method: Projects functional predictors onto finite-dimensional subspaces via robust functional PCA, then uses M-type estimators for logistic regression coefficients based on robust principal component scores.

Result: Outperforms existing robust and non-robust methods when outliers are present, maintains competitive performance without outliers, and is computationally more efficient than existing robust alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed robust procedure effectively handles outliers in functional logistic regression while maintaining computational efficiency and competitive performance.

Abstract: Functional logistic regression is a popular model to capture a linear
relationship between binary response and functional predictor variables.
However, many methods used for parameter estimation in functional logistic
regression are sensitive to outliers, which may lead to inaccurate parameter
estimates and inferior classification accuracy. We propose a robust estimation
procedure for functional logistic regression, in which the observations of the
functional predictor are projected onto a set of finite-dimensional subspaces
via robust functional principal component analysis. This dimension-reduction
step reduces the outlying effects in the functional predictor. The logistic
regression coefficient is estimated using an M-type estimator based on binary
response and robust principal component scores. In doing so, we provide robust
estimates by minimizing the effects of outliers in the binary response and
functional predictor variables. Via a series of Monte-Carlo simulations and
using hand radiograph data, we examine the parameter estimation and
classification accuracy for the response variable. We find that the robust
procedure outperforms some existing robust and non-robust methods when outliers
are present, while producing competitive results when outliers are absent. In
addition, the proposed method is computationally more efficient than some
existing robust alternatives.

### [9] [Edgington's Method for Random-Effects Meta-Analysis Part I: Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12301)
*David Kronthaler,Leonhard Held*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper extends meta-analysis by incorporating uncertainty in heterogeneity estimation using confidence distributions, improving confidence interval coverage while maintaining practical applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional meta-analysis methods by accounting for uncertainty in heterogeneity estimation, which can affect the accuracy of confidence intervals and point estimates.

Method: Extends meta-analytic estimation framework using combined p-value functions and employs confidence distribution approach. Specifically adjusts Edgington's method confidence distribution based on heterogeneity parameter confidence distribution constructed from generalized heterogeneity statistic.

Result: Simulations show 95% confidence intervals approach nominal coverage with more than 3 studies and heterogeneity. Under no heterogeneity or only 3 studies, intervals overcover but are narrower than Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman intervals. Point estimator shows small bias under model misspecification and moderate to large heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Edgington's method with heterogeneity uncertainty adjustment provides a practical alternative to classical approaches, often improving confidence interval coverage in meta-analysis.

Abstract: Meta-analysis can be formulated as combining $p$-values across studies into a
joint $p$-value function, from which point estimates and confidence intervals
can be derived. We extend the meta-analytic estimation framework based on
combined $p$-value functions to incorporate uncertainty in heterogeneity
estimation by employing a confidence distribution approach. Specifically, the
confidence distribution of Edgington's method is adjusted according to the
confidence distribution of the heterogeneity parameter constructed from the
generalized heterogeneity statistic. Simulation results suggest that 95%
confidence intervals approach nominal coverage under most scenarios involving
more than three studies and heterogeneity. Under no heterogeneity or for only
three studies, the confidence interval typically overcovers, but is often
narrower than the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman interval. The point estimator
exhibits small bias under model misspecification and moderate to large
heterogeneity. Edgington's method provides a practical alternative to classical
approaches, with adjustment for heterogeneity estimation uncertainty often
improving confidence interval coverage.

*Nina Drobac,Margaux Brégère,Joseph de Vilmarest,Olivier Wintenberger*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A novel time series forecasting framework using ridge regression with signature features on sliding windows, which captures complex temporal dynamics without learned representations, with theoretical guarantees and efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear and delayed effects of covariates make time series forecasting challenging, requiring methods that can capture complex temporal dynamics without relying on expert knowledge or learned representations.

Method: Proposes ridge regression with signature features computed on sliding windows, which automatically capture temporal patterns. Includes theoretical analysis of universality and stationarity, plus an efficient sequential algorithm for signature computation.

Result: Evaluation on synthetic and real electricity demand data shows signature features effectively encode temporal and nonlinear dependencies, producing forecasts competitive with expert-based methods.

Conclusion: Signature features provide an effective way to capture complex temporal dynamics in time series forecasting, offering competitive performance without requiring expert knowledge or learned representations.

Abstract: Nonlinear and delayed effects of covariates often render time series
forecasting challenging. To this end, we propose a novel forecasting framework
based on ridge regression with signature features calculated on sliding
windows. These features capture complex temporal dynamics without relying on
learned or hand-crafted representations. Focusing on the discrete-time setting,
we establish theoretical guarantees, namely universality of approximation and
stationarity of signatures. We introduce an efficient sequential algorithm for
computing signatures on sliding windows. The method is evaluated on both
synthetic and real electricity demand data. Results show that signature
features effectively encode temporal and nonlinear dependencies, yielding
accurate forecasts competitive with those based on expert knowledge.

### [11] [Variational Inference for Count Response Semiparametric Regression: A Convex Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12356)
*Virginia Murru,Matt P. Wand*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A variational inference method for Bayesian count response models with convexity and closed-form updates, using Pólya-Gamma augmentation and structured mean field variational Bayes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a variational inference approach for Bayesian count response regression models that is numerically stable, fast, and easy to implement.

Method: Uses Pólya-Gamma augmentation of Negative Binomial likelihood, finite-valued prior on shape parameter, and structured mean field variational Bayes paradigm.

Result: The method achieves convex solutions with closed-form updates, enabling numerically stable fitting algorithms and fast implementation.

Conclusion: The approach provides an efficient variational inference framework for general count response models, demonstrated through generalized linear mixed models in semiparametric regression.

Abstract: We develop a version of variational inference for Bayesian count response
regression-type models that possesses attractive attributes such as convexity
and closed form updates. The convex solution aspect entails numerically stable
fitting algorithms, whilst the closed form aspect makes the methodology fast
and easy to implement. The essence of the approach is the use of P\'olya-Gamma
augmentation of a Negative Binomial likelihood, a finite-valued prior on the
shape parameter and the structured mean field variational Bayes paradigm. The
approach applies to general count response situations. For concreteness, we
focus on generalized linear mixed models within the semiparametric regression
class of models. Real-time fitting is also described.

### [12] [Causal inference of post-transcriptional regulation timelines from long-read sequencing in Arabidopsis thaliana](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12504)
*Rubén Martos,Christophe Ambroise,Guillem Rigaill*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A causal inference framework using Pearl's theory to reconstruct genetic regulation chronology through causal discovery, inference, and timeline construction, applied to Arabidopsis chloroplast genes with solutions for missing data and regularization parameter selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a systematic approach for reconstructing genetic regulation timelines using causal inference methods, addressing challenges in biological chronology modeling.

Method: Three-stage framework: causal discovery (using HC, PC, LiNGAM, NOTEARS algorithms), causal inference, and chronology construction. Handles missing data via EM algorithm and uses stability selection for regularization parameter optimization.

Result: Generated four alternative maturation timeline models per gene that consistently outperform reference chronologies in reliability and model fit. The framework enables testable hypothesis formulation and targeted experimental design.

Conclusion: The causal inference framework provides robust genetic regulation chronology reconstruction, combining computational methods with domain expertise to generate biologically meaningful models and predictions.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for reconstructing the chronology of genetic
regulation using causal inference based on Pearl's theory. The approach
proceeds in three main stages: causal discovery, causal inference, and
chronology construction. We apply it to the ndhB and ndhD genes of the
chloroplast in Arabidopsis thaliana, generating four alternative maturation
timeline models per gene, each derived from a different causal discovery
algorithm (HC, PC, LiNGAM, or NOTEARS). Two methodological challenges are
addressed: the presence of missing data, handled via an EM algorithm that
jointly imputes missing values and estimates the Bayesian network, and the
selection of the $\ell_1$-regularization parameter in NOTEARS, for which we
introduce a stability selection strategy. The resulting causal models
consistently outperform reference chronologies in terms of both reliability and
model fit. Moreover, by combining causal reasoning with domain expertise, the
framework enables the formulation of testable hypotheses and the design of
targeted experimental interventions grounded in theoretical predictions.

### [13] [On goodness-of-fit testing for volatility in McKean-Vlasov models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12607)
*Akram Heidari,Mark Podolskij*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A statistical framework for goodness-of-fit testing of volatility functions in McKean-Vlasov SDEs, analyzing particle systems in joint large-particle and high-frequency regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in formal model validation and goodness-of-fit testing for McKean-Vlasov systems, which describe interacting particle systems with distribution-dependent dynamics, as existing methods focus on classical SDEs.

Method: Proposes a test statistic based on discrete observations of particle systems, analyzed in a joint regime where both the number of particles and sampling frequency increase simultaneously.

Result: The estimators are proven to be consistent, and the test statistic satisfies a central limit theorem, converging in distribution to a centred Gaussian law.

Conclusion: The framework provides a rigorous statistical approach for validating volatility functions in McKean-Vlasov SDEs, bridging an important gap in the analysis of interacting particle systems.

Abstract: This paper develops a statistical framework for goodness-of-fit testing of
volatility functions in McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations, which
describe large systems of interacting particles with distribution-dependent
dynamics. While integrated volatility estimation in classical SDEs is now well
established, formal model validation and goodness-of-fit testing for
McKean-Vlasov systems remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes with
both large particle limits and high-frequency sampling. We propose a test
statistic based on discrete observations of particle systems, analysed in a
joint regime where both the number of particles and the sampling frequency
increase. The estimators involved are proven to be consistent, and the test
statistic is shown to satisfy a central limit theorem, converging in
distribution to a centred Gaussian law.

### [14] [The $α$--regression for compositional data: a unified framework for standard, spatially-lagged, and geographically-weighted regression models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12663)
*Michail Tsagris*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper revisits α-regression for compositional data analysis, providing efficient estimation methods and extending the framework to spatial settings with two models that improve predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional regression struggles with compositional data (non-negative vectors summing to unity) due to unit-sum constraints and zero values, while existing methods often require imputation or lack flexibility.

Method: Formulates α-regression as non-linear least squares with efficient estimation via Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, provides explicit gradient/Hessian derivations, and extends to spatial settings with α-spatially lagged X regression and geographically weighted α-regression models.

Result: Established asymptotic normality of estimators, derived marginal effects for interpretation, and demonstrated through Greek agricultural land-use data that spatial extensions substantially improve predictive performance.

Conclusion: The α-regression framework provides a flexible approach for compositional data analysis that naturally handles zeros without imputation, with spatial extensions offering significant improvements for capturing spatial relationships in compositional data.

Abstract: Compositional data-vectors of non--negative components summing to
unity--frequently arise in scientific applications where covariates influence
the relative proportions of components, yet traditional regression approaches
struggle with the unit-sum constraint and zero values. This paper revisits the
$\alpha$--regression framework, which uses a flexible power transformation
parameterized by $\alpha$ to interpolate between raw data analysis and
log-ratio methods, naturally handling zeros without imputation while allowing
data-driven transformation selection. We formulate $\alpha$--regression as a
non-linear least squares problem, provide efficient estimation via the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with explicit gradient and Hessian derivations,
establish asymptotic normality of the estimators, and derive marginal effects
for interpretation. The framework is extended to spatial settings through two
models: the $\alpha$--spatially lagged X regression model, which incorporates
spatial spillover effects via spatially lagged covariates with decomposition
into direct and indirect effects, and the geographically weighted
$\alpha$--regression, which allows coefficients to vary spatially for capturing
local relationships. Application to Greek agricultural land-use data
demonstrates that spatial extensions substantially improve predictive
performance.

### [15] [Dimension-Free Minimax Rates for Learning Pairwise Interactions in Attention-Style Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11789)
*Shai Zucker,Xiong Wang,Fei Lu,Inbar Seroussi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the convergence rate of learning pairwise interactions in single-layer attention models, showing that the minimax rate is M^(-2β/(2β+1)) where M is sample size and β is activation smoothness, independent of token count, dimension, or matrix rank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental statistical efficiency of attention-style models and provide theoretical insights into how attention mechanisms learn pairwise interactions, particularly examining whether the convergence depends on model complexity factors like token count or dimensionality.

Method: Theoretical analysis of single-layer attention-style models where tokens interact through a weight matrix and non-linear activation function. The study proves minimax convergence rates using mathematical analysis of the learning problem.

Result: The minimax convergence rate is M^(-2β/(2β+1)), which depends only on the smoothness β of the activation function and is independent of token count, ambient dimension, or rank of the weight matrix.

Conclusion: Attention-style nonlocal models exhibit fundamental dimension-free statistical efficiency, meaning their learning performance doesn't degrade with increasing model complexity, providing theoretical justification for the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in practice.

Abstract: We study the convergence rate of learning pairwise interactions in
single-layer attention-style models, where tokens interact through a weight
matrix and a non-linear activation function. We prove that the minimax rate is
$M^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$ with $M$ being the sample size, depending only
on the smoothness $\beta$ of the activation, and crucially independent of token
count, ambient dimension, or rank of the weight matrix. These results highlight
a fundamental dimension-free statistical efficiency of attention-style nonlocal
models, even when the weight matrix and activation are not separately
identifiable and provide a theoretical understanding of the attention mechanism
and its training.

### [16] [On Thompson Sampling and Bilateral Uncertainty in Additive Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11792)
*Nathan Wycoff*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper investigates the practical effects of ignoring bilateral uncertainty (pairwise covariances) in additive Bayesian Optimization, finding that while the additive approximation to Thompson Sampling performs slightly worse than exact methods, the difference is practically insignificant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Additive assumptions in Bayesian Optimization help with high-dimensional problems, but common acquisition functions ignore pairwise covariances (bilateral uncertainty), creating additional approximations. While theoretical results suggest minimal loss asymptotically, little is known about practical effects with small budgets.

Method: The authors exploit conditional independence to efficiently conduct Thompson Sampling that respects bilateral uncertainty, enabling empirical investigation into the performance loss from ignoring these covariances.

Result: The additive approximation to Thompson Sampling does show worse performance than the exact method, but the difference is of little practical significance.

Conclusion: The BU-ignoring approximation is sufficient for Bayesian Optimization in practice, even in non-asymptotic regimes, supporting theoretical understanding that the performance loss is negligible.

Abstract: In Bayesian Optimization (BO), additive assumptions can mitigate the twin
difficulties of modeling and searching a complex function in high dimension.
However, common acquisition functions, like the Additive Lower Confidence
Bound, ignore pairwise covariances between dimensions, which we'll call
\textit{bilateral uncertainty} (BU), imposing a second layer of approximations.
While theoretical results indicate that asymptotically not much is lost in
doing so, little is known about the practical effects of this assumption in
small budgets. In this article, we show that by exploiting conditional
independence, Thompson Sampling respecting BU can be efficiently conducted. We
use this fact to execute an empirical investigation into the loss incurred by
ignoring BU, finding that the additive approximation to Thompson Sampling does
indeed have, on balance, worse performance than the exact method, but that this
difference is of little practical significance. This buttresses the theoretical
understanding and suggests that the BU-ignoring approximation is sufficient for
BO in practice, even in the non-asymptotic regime.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize active subspace methodology for supervised dimension reduction to functionals on Hilbert spaces, enabling its application to infinite-dimensional problems.

Method: Define an operator equivalent to the active subspace matrix for Hilbert spaces, prove extension of properties to infinite dimensions, and propose a Monte Carlo procedure with convergence analysis.

Result: Successfully extended active subspace analysis to Hilbert spaces, maintaining desirable properties, and demonstrated practical application through visualizations and improved modeling/optimization on test problems.

Conclusion: Active subspace methodology can be effectively generalized to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces while preserving its core properties, enabling broader applications in functional analysis and optimization.

Abstract: Active subspace analysis uses the leading eigenspace of the gradient's second
moment to conduct supervised dimension reduction. In this article, we extend
this methodology to real-valued functionals on Hilbert space. We define an
operator which coincides with the active subspace matrix when applied to a
Euclidean space. We show that many of the desirable properties of Active
Subspace analysis extend directly to the infinite dimensional setting. We also
propose a Monte Carlo procedure and discuss its convergence properties.
Finally, we deploy this methodology to create visualizations and improve
modeling and optimization on complex test problems.

*Maryam Aliakbarpour,Alireza Fallah,Swaha Roy,Ria Stevens*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper develops high-probability finite sample guarantees for statistical estimation under heterogeneous local differential privacy (LDP), focusing on mean estimation and distribution learning problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDP analyses typically provide in-expectation guarantees, but real-world applications require high-probability accuracy bounds, especially when users have varying privacy levels.

Method: The authors develop novel algorithms for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional mean estimation under heterogeneous LDP constraints, and design distribution learning algorithms in ℓ∞-distance with high-probability guarantees.

Result: The paper establishes finite sample upper bounds in ℓ2-norm that hold with probability at least 1-β, and provides matching minimax lower bounds proving the optimality of their guarantees in the heterogeneous LDP regime.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques offer principled guidance for designing mechanisms in settings with user-specific privacy levels, bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical requirements for high-probability accuracy in heterogeneous LDP settings.

Abstract: We study statistical estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) when
users may hold heterogeneous privacy levels and accuracy must be guaranteed
with high probability. Departing from the common in-expectation analyses, and
for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional mean estimation problems, we develop
finite sample upper bounds in $\ell_2$-norm that hold with probability at least
$1-\beta$. We complement these results with matching minimax lower bounds,
establishing the optimality (up to constants) of our guarantees in the
heterogeneous LDP regime. We further study distribution learning in
$\ell_\infty$-distance, designing an algorithm with high-probability guarantees
under heterogeneous privacy demands. Our techniques offer principled guidance
for designing mechanisms in settings with user-specific privacy levels.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A new framework for low-rank optimal transport recovery using Schatten-p norm regularization, providing unified convex programs with theoretical guarantees and efficient mirror descent algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend existing methods for sparse transport maps by promoting low-rank structure in optimal transport, enabling more interpretable and dimensionally-reduced transport plans.

Method: Schatten-p norm regularization framework with convex programs, analyzed through optimality conditions and recovery guarantees, solved via mirror descent algorithm for p ≥ 1.

Result: The method demonstrates efficiency, scalability, and successful recovery of low-rank transport structures in both synthetic and real data experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively recovers low-rank structure in optimal transport with theoretical guarantees and practical computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a new general framework for recovering low-rank structure in
optimal transport using Schatten-$p$ norm regularization. Our approach extends
existing methods that promote sparse and interpretable transport maps or plans,
while providing a unified and principled family of convex programs that
encourage low-dimensional structure. The convexity of our formulation enables
direct theoretical analysis: we derive optimality conditions and prove recovery
guarantees for low-rank couplings and barycentric maps in simplified settings.
To efficiently solve the proposed program, we develop a mirror descent
algorithm with convergence guarantees for $p \geq 1$. Experiments on synthetic
and real data demonstrate the method's efficiency, scalability, and ability to
recover low-rank transport structures.

*Jiaqi Li,Zhipeng Lou,Johannes Schmidt-Hieber,Wei Biao Wu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper provides rigorous statistical guarantees for constant learning-rate SGD and ASGD in high-dimensional regimes by viewing SGD as a nonlinear autoregressive process and adapting coupling techniques from high-dimensional time series analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGD and ASGD are fundamental to modern large-scale learning, but their theoretical properties in high-dimensional settings are poorly understood, creating a critical gap in the theory of online learning algorithms.

Method: The authors transfer tools from high-dimensional time series to online learning by viewing SGD as a nonlinear autoregressive process and adapting existing coupling techniques to prove geometric-moment contraction and establish asymptotic stationarity of iterates.

Result: The paper derives q-th moment convergence of SGD and ASGD for any q≥2 in general ℓ^s-norms, particularly the ℓ^∞-norm used in high-dimensional sparse models, and provides sharp high-probability concentration analysis with probabilistic bounds for high-dimensional ASGD.

Conclusion: The proposed framework not only closes a critical gap in SGD theory but also offers a novel toolkit for analyzing a broad class of high-dimensional learning algorithms, establishing rigorous statistical guarantees for constant learning-rate methods in high-dimensional regimes.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its Ruppert-Polyak averaged variant
(ASGD) lie at the heart of modern large-scale learning, yet their theoretical
properties in high-dimensional settings are rarely understood. In this paper,
we provide rigorous statistical guarantees for constant learning-rate SGD and
ASGD in high-dimensional regimes. Our key innovation is to transfer powerful
tools from high-dimensional time series to online learning. Specifically, by
viewing SGD as a nonlinear autoregressive process and adapting existing
coupling techniques, we prove the geometric-moment contraction of
high-dimensional SGD for constant learning rates, thereby establishing
asymptotic stationarity of the iterates. Building on this, we derive the $q$-th
moment convergence of SGD and ASGD for any $q\ge2$ in general $\ell^s$-norms,
and, in particular, the $\ell^{\infty}$-norm that is frequently adopted in
high-dimensional sparse or structured models. Furthermore, we provide sharp
high-probability concentration analysis which entails the probabilistic bound
of high-dimensional ASGD. Beyond closing a critical gap in SGD theory, our
proposed framework offers a novel toolkit for analyzing a broad class of
high-dimensional learning algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously study neural network compressibility by extending the minimum description length principle to singular models like neural networks.

Method: Using singular learning theory to extend MDL, then conducting extensive experiments on the Pythia suite with quantization, factorization, and other compression techniques.

Result: Complexity estimates based on the local learning coefficient are closely, and sometimes linearly, correlated with compressibility.

Conclusion: The results provide a path toward rigorously evaluating the limits of model compression.

Abstract: We study neural network compressibility by using singular learning theory to

*Bogdan Butyrin,Eric Moulines,Alexey Naumov,Sergey Samsonov,Qi-Man Shao,Zhuo-Song Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper improves Berry-Esseen bounds for multivariate normal approximation of Polyak-Ruppert averaged iterates in linear stochastic approximation with decreasing step size, establishing rates up to n^{-1/3} in convex distance and proving non-asymptotic validity of multiplier bootstrap with improved rates up to 1/√n.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine the Berry-Esseen bounds for multivariate normal approximation of averaged iterates in linear stochastic approximation algorithms, addressing limitations in existing convergence rate analyses and improving upon previous results.

Method: The authors analyze Polyak-Ruppert averaged iterates from linear stochastic approximation with decreasing step size, using Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix predicted by Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem. They establish convergence rates in convex distance and prove non-asymptotic validity of multiplier bootstrap procedures.

Result: Achieved convergence rate up to order n^{-1/3} in convex distance for normal approximation, and significantly improved approximation rates up to 1/√n for the distribution of rescaled error of averaged LSA estimator, surpassing previous results by Samsonov et al. (2024).

Conclusion: The paper provides refined Berry-Esseen bounds and establishes improved convergence rates for multivariate normal approximation in linear stochastic approximation algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of multiplier bootstrap procedures for practical applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we refine the Berry-Esseen bounds for the multivariate normal
approximation of Polyak-Ruppert averaged iterates arising from the linear
stochastic approximation (LSA) algorithm with decreasing step size. We consider
the normal approximation by the Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix
predicted by the Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem and establish the rate
up to order $n^{-1/3}$ in convex distance, where $n$ is the number of samples
used in the algorithm. We also prove a non-asymptotic validity of the
multiplier bootstrap procedure for approximating the distribution of the
rescaled error of the averaged LSA estimator. We establish approximation rates
of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$ for the latter distribution, which significantly
improves upon the previous results obtained by Samsonov et al. (2024).

*Chaiwon Kim,Jongyeong Lee,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader policy with Pareto perturbations for decoupled multi-armed bandits, achieving Best-of-Both-Worlds performance with constant regret in stochastic environments and minimax optimal regret in adversarial settings, while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the decoupled MAB problem where exploration and exploitation arms are selected separately each round, with the goal of achieving optimal performance in both stochastic and adversarial environments while avoiding computational bottlenecks of previous approaches.

Method: A Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) framework using Pareto perturbations that eliminates the need for convex optimization and resampling steps required by previous methods like Decoupled-Tsallis-INF.

Result: The policy achieves constant regret in stochastic regimes (improving upon standard MAB bounds), minimax optimal regret in adversarial regimes, and runs about 20 times faster than Decoupled-Tsallis-INF while showing better empirical performance.

Conclusion: The proposed FTPL with Pareto perturbations provides a practical and computationally efficient solution for decoupled MABs that outperforms both previous BOBW approaches and naive combinations of exploration/exploitation policies.

Abstract: We study the decoupled multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where the learner
selects one arm for exploration and one arm for exploitation in each round. The
loss of the explored arm is observed but not counted, while the loss of the
exploited arm is incurred without being observed. We propose a policy within
the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) framework using Pareto perturbations.
Our policy achieves (near-)optimal regret regardless of the environment, i.e.,
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW): constant regret in the stochastic regime, improving
upon the optimal bound of the standard MABs, and minimax optimal regret in the
adversarial regime. Moreover, the practicality of our policy stems from
avoiding both the convex optimization step required by the previous BOBW
policy, Decoupled-Tsallis-INF (Rouyer & Seldin, 2020), and the resampling step
that is typically necessary in FTPL. Consequently, it achieves substantial
computational improvement, about $20$ times faster than Decoupled-Tsallis-INF,
while also demonstrating better empirical performance in both regimes. Finally,
we empirically show that our approach outperforms a pure exploration policy,
and that naively combining a pure exploration with a standard exploitation
policy is suboptimal.

*Do Tien Hai,Trung Nguyen Mai,TrungTin Nguyen,Nhat Ho,Binh T. Nguyen,Christopher Drovandi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A unified statistical framework for softmax-gated Gaussian mixture of experts (SGMoE) that solves parameter estimation and model selection challenges, including non-identifiability issues and gate-expert interactions, with Voronoi-type loss functions and dendrogram-based model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address three long-standing obstacles in SGMoE: (i) non-identifiability of gating parameters, (ii) intrinsic gate-expert interactions causing coupled differential relations, and (iii) tight numerator-denominator coupling in softmax-induced conditional density.

Method: Introduces Voronoi-type loss functions aligned with gate-partition geometry, establishes finite-sample convergence rates for MLE, and adapts dendrograms of mixing measures for model selection that avoids multi-size training.

Result: Achieves finite-sample convergence rates for MLE, reveals link between convergence rate and polynomial equation solvability in over-specified models, and provides consistent model selection that attains pointwise-optimal parameter rates. Simulations show accurate expert count recovery and robust performance under model misspecification.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses SGMoE's fundamental challenges, with dendrogram-guided selection outperforming standard criteria (AIC, BIC, ICL) and providing interpretable results on real-world datasets like maize proteomics data.

Abstract: We develop a unified statistical framework for softmax-gated Gaussian mixture
of experts (SGMoE) that addresses three long-standing obstacles in parameter
estimation and model selection: (i) non-identifiability of gating parameters up
to common translations, (ii) intrinsic gate-expert interactions that induce
coupled differential relations in the likelihood, and (iii) the tight
numerator-denominator coupling in the softmax-induced conditional density. Our
approach introduces Voronoi-type loss functions aligned with the gate-partition
geometry and establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE). In over-specified models, we reveal a link between
the MLE's convergence rate and the solvability of an associated system of
polynomial equations characterizing near-nonidentifiable directions. For model
selection, we adapt dendrograms of mixing measures to SGMoE, yielding a
consistent, sweep-free selector of the number of experts that attains
pointwise-optimal parameter rates under overfitting while avoiding multi-size
training. Simulations on synthetic data corroborate the theory, accurately
recovering the expert count and achieving the predicted rates for parameter
estimation while closely approximating the regression function. Under model
misspecification (e.g., $\epsilon$-contamination), the dendrogram selection
criterion is robust, recovering the true number of mixture components, while
the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the
integrated completed likelihood tend to overselect as sample size grows. On a
maize proteomics dataset of drought-responsive traits, our dendrogram-guided
SGMoE selects two experts, exposes a clear mixing-measure hierarchy, stabilizes
the likelihood early, and yields interpretable genotype-phenotype maps,
outperforming standard criteria without multi-size training.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a high-frequency daily panel dataset of market and news-based indicators for 42 countries to study how sentiment dynamics affect sovereign risk and their forecasting value compared to traditional drivers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how sentiment dynamics from news-based indicators shape sovereign risk and evaluate their forecasting value relative to traditional drivers like global monetary policy and market volatility.

Method: Uses a novel high-frequency daily panel dataset of markets and news-based indicators for 42 countries, conducts horse-race analysis of forecasting models, and employs non-linear machine learning methods (particularly Random Forests) to analyze sovereign risk measured by Credit Default Swap spreads.

Result: Incorporating news-based indicators significantly enhances predictive accuracy, with non-linear machine learning methods delivering the largest gains. While global financial variables remain dominant, geopolitical risk and economic policy uncertainty play meaningful roles, with effects amplified through non-linear interactions. Regional heterogeneity is pronounced, with certain asset classes and emerging markets showing heightened sensitivity to shocks.

Conclusion: News-based sentiment indicators significantly improve sovereign risk forecasting, with non-linear machine learning methods providing the best performance, and there are important regional differences in sensitivity to various risk factors.

Abstract: We introduce a novel high-frequency daily panel dataset of both markets and
news-based indicators -- including Geopolitical Risk, Economic Policy
Uncertainty, Trade Policy Uncertainty, and Political Sentiment -- for 42
countries across both emerging and developed markets. Using this dataset, we
study how sentiment dynamics shape sovereign risk, measured by Credit Default
Swap (CDS) spreads, and evaluate their forecasting value relative to
traditional drivers such as global monetary policy and market volatility. Our
horse-race analysis of forecasting models demonstrates that incorporating
news-based indicators significantly enhances predictive accuracy and enriches
the analysis, with non-linear machine learning methods -- particularly Random
Forests -- delivering the largest gains. Our analysis reveals that while global
financial variables remain the dominant drivers of sovereign risk, geopolitical
risk and economic policy uncertainty also play a meaningful role. Crucially,
their effects are amplified through non-linear interactions with global
financial conditions. Finally, we document pronounced regional heterogeneity,
as certain asset classes and emerging markets exhibit heightened sensitivity to
shocks in policy rates, global financial volatility, and geopolitical risk.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: UAED is a framework that learns environment distributions through data transformations to improve out-of-distribution generalization without predefined groups or manual environment design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of models exploiting spurious correlations in data and the challenge of selecting appropriate environments for training robust models when environments are rarely known beforehand.

Method: Proposes Universal Adaptive Environment Discovery (UAED) which learns a distribution over data transformations that instantiate environments and optimizes robust objectives averaged over this learned distribution.

Result: UAED discovers interpretable environment distributions, improves worst-case accuracy on standard benchmarks while remaining competitive on mean accuracy, and provides adaptive variants of IRM, REx, GroupDRO, and CORAL.

Conclusion: Making environments adaptive through UAED is a practical approach for achieving out-of-distribution generalization without requiring predefined groups or manual environment design.

Abstract: An open problem in Machine Learning is how to avoid models to exploit
spurious correlations in the data; a famous example is the background-label
shortcut in the Waterbirds dataset. A common remedy is to train a model across
multiple environments; in the Waterbirds dataset, this corresponds to training
by randomizing the background. However, selecting the right environments is a
challenging problem, given that these are rarely known a priori. We propose
Universal Adaptive Environment Discovery (UAED), a unified framework that
learns a distribution over data transformations that instantiate environments,
and optimizes any robust objective averaged over this learned distribution.
UAED yields adaptive variants of IRM, REx, GroupDRO, and CORAL without
predefined groups or manual environment design. We provide a theoretical
analysis by providing PAC-Bayes bounds and by showing robustness to test
environment distributions under standard conditions. Empirically, UAED
discovers interpretable environment distributions and improves worst-case
accuracy on standard benchmarks, while remaining competitive on mean accuracy.
Our results indicate that making environments adaptive is a practical route to
out-of-distribution generalization.

Motivation: To create more flexible generative models beyond standard diffusion processes by making the noising processes themselves learnable and adaptable to data characteristics.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Sinkhorn algorithm's vanishing-step-size limit as a mirror descent flow, establishes L^2 contraction criteria, derives entropy production rates, and connects it to reversible Markov dynamics with spectral gap analysis and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous mathematical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm's continuous-time limit, establishing its connection to mirror descent flows and developing spectral analysis tools for understanding its convergence properties.

Method: The authors analyze the Sinkhorn flow as a mirror descent in probability space, establish L^2 contraction criteria using mirror Hessian metrics, derive exact entropy production rates, and connect the flow to reversible Markov dynamics with spectral gap analysis and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.

Result: The paper shows the Sinkhorn flow induces reversible Markov dynamics as an Onsager gradient flow, proves a Poincaré inequality with strictly positive spectral gap for ε>0, and establishes that entropy decay is exponential if and only if a logarithmic Sobolev inequality holds.

Conclusion: The analysis provides fundamental insights into Sinkhorn algorithm convergence, with practical applications including design principles for generative model latent spaces and stopping heuristics for discrete-time algorithms.

Abstract: Recently, the vanishing-step-size limit of the Sinkhorn algorithm at finite
regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ was shown to be a mirror descent in the
space of probability measures. We give $L^2$ contraction criteria in two
time-dependent metrics induced by the mirror Hessian, which reduce to the
coercivity of certain conditional expectation operators. We then give an exact
identity for the entropy production rate of the Sinkhorn flow, which was
previously known only to be nonpositive. Examining this rate shows that the
standard semigroup analysis of diffusion processes extends systematically to
the Sinkhorn flow. We show that the flow induces a reversible Markov dynamics
on the target marginal as an Onsager gradient flow. We define the Dirichlet
form associated to its (nonlocal) infinitesimal generator, prove a Poincar\'e
inequality for it, and show that the spectral gap is strictly positive along
the Sinkhorn flow whenever $\varepsilon > 0$. Lastly, we show that the entropy
decay is exponential if and only if a logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI)
holds. We give for illustration two immediate practical use-cases for the
Sinkhorn LSI: as a design principle for the latent space in which generative
models are trained, and as a stopping heuristic for discrete-time algorithms.

*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor is a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that provides intrinsic interpretability while integrating clinical course identification, demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness into its reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU mortality prediction requires both accuracy and interpretability for clinical trust and regulatory compliance. Current approaches focus mainly on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical course identification and prognostication awareness.

Method: ProtoDoctor features two key modules: Prognostic Clinical Course Identification (using prototype learning with novel regularization) and Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition (using cohort-specific prototypes and risk adjustments).

Result: Extensive empirical evaluations show ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy. Human evaluations confirm its interpretations are more clinically meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable.

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor successfully integrates all three key elements of ICU decision-making practices into an interpretable mortality prediction framework, demonstrating superior performance and clinical utility.

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

Motivation: Current approaches for solving math problems in verifiable languages rely on expensive online RL or expert iteration with fixed problem sets, leading to inefficient training and limitations in tackling complex problems.

Method: Proposed GAR framework that trains problem composer and solver jointly in an adversarial loop, introducing implicit curriculum learning that aligns task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability.

Result: GAR training achieved 4.20% average relative improvement in pass@32 on MiniF2F-Test benchmark for Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, and increased DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on ProofNet-Test from 22.58% to 25.81%.

Conclusion: GAR establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and solving under verifiable environments, improving training efficiency and enabling stronger performance on advanced theorems.

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Node-level anomaly detection is challenging due to diverse structural patterns and feature distributions, yet critical for applications like fraud detection, cybersecurity, and recommendation systems.

Method: Each node is described by two views (original features and structural features from random walks/degrees), embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder with contrastive learning aligns embeddings across spaces to identify nodes with difficult-to-reconcile views as anomalies.

Result: Experiments on four real-world datasets show Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines.

Conclusion: Combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

### [33] [Schrödinger bridge for generative AI: Soft-constrained formulation and convergence analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11829)
*Jin Ma,Ying Tan,Renyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a soft-constrained Schrödinger bridge problem (SCSBP) that replaces hard terminal constraints with penalty functions, providing more flexible stochastic control for generative AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical Schrödinger bridge problems enforce hard terminal constraints, which leads to instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or data-scarce scenarios. The authors aim to address this limitation.

Method: The authors propose a soft-constrained Schrödinger bridge problem formulation using McKean-Vlasov type stochastic control. They establish existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and prove linear convergence to classical SBP as penalty increases, using Doob's h-transform, Schrödinger potential stability, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument.

Result: The paper proves that controls and value functions converge to those of classical SBP at a linear rate as penalty grows. It provides the first quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges.

Conclusion: The soft-constrained approach enables more robust generative modeling, fine-tuning, and transfer learning by addressing the instability issues of classical Schrödinger bridge problems through penalty regularization.

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

*Narine Kokhlikyan,Kamalika Chaudhuri,Saeed Mahloujifar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new zeroth-order method for efficiently estimating training data influence in machine learning models, requiring only loss values and checkpoints without gradients or inverse-Hessian computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior is crucial for data selection and model debugging, but existing methods are impractical for large models due to computational costs and poor approximations.

Method: Proposes a zeroth-order approximation using only loss values from intermediate checkpoints on training and test data, along with the checkpoints themselves, avoiding gradient computations.

Result: The method achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large language models.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable and practical analysis of how training data shapes model behavior, being broadly applicable even with non-differentiable loss functions.

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

### [35] [Don't Walk the Line: Boundary Guidance for Filtered Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11834)
*Sarah Ball,Andreas Haupt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Boundary Guidance is a reinforcement learning method that fine-tunes generative models to steer generation away from safety classifier boundaries, improving both safety and utility compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fine-tuning approaches that reduce the probability of being filtered by safety classifiers often push models toward classifier decision boundaries, increasing false positives and false negatives, which is suboptimal for safety.

Method: Boundary Guidance uses reinforcement learning fine-tuning to explicitly steer generation away from the classifier's margin, avoiding problematic boundary regions.

Result: On jailbreak and ambiguous prompt benchmarks, Boundary Guidance improves both safety and utility of outputs according to LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, with robust performance across model scales and reward designs.

Conclusion: The proposed Boundary Guidance method effectively addresses limitations of standard safety fine-tuning by avoiding classifier boundaries, leading to better safety-utility tradeoffs in generative models.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

*Yu-Hsiang Wang,Olgica Milenkovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WaveletDiff is a novel diffusion model framework that generates high-quality synthetic time series by training directly on wavelet coefficients, combining multi-resolution transformers with cross-level attention and energy preservation constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large, high-quality time series datasets are scarce, and existing synthetic generation models struggle to reproduce the multi-scaled structure of real-world time series confined to either time or frequency domains.

Method: Trains diffusion models on wavelet coefficients using dedicated transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms and adaptive gating, incorporating energy preservation constraints based on Parseval's theorem.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods across six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains, achieving discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are 3× smaller on average than the second-best baseline.

Conclusion: WaveletDiff effectively addresses the limitations of current time series generation methods by leveraging wavelet decomposition to capture multi-resolution structure while preserving spectral fidelity, demonstrating superior performance across diverse metrics and datasets.

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

*Urs Spiegelhalter,Jörg K. H. Franke,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the optimal replay ratios for balancing task performance and knowledge retention when adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining, using bAbI reasoning tasks and synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental trade-off in adapting language models: learning new capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. Prior work hasn't sufficiently addressed optimal replay ratios under computational constraints.

Method: Comprehensive empirical study using bAbI reasoning tasks with synthetic data generation, systematically evaluating different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations.

Result: The experiments revealed an optimal configuration that balances task-specific performance with general knowledge retention, enabling strong task adaptation with reduced training costs.

Conclusion: The study provides empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on computational budget, helping practitioners achieve efficient task adaptation while maintaining knowledge retention.

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

*Saroj Basnet,Shafkat Farabi,Tharindu Ranasinghe,Diptesh Kanoji,Marcos Zampieri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evaluation of 7 state-of-the-art vision-language models on multimodal sarcasm detection and explanation generation using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting across three benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage recent advances in open-source vision-language models for understanding complex multimodal phenomena like sarcasm, and to assess their capabilities in both detecting sarcasm and generating explanations.

Method: Evaluated 7 VLMs (BLIP2, InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, Qwen-VL) on three sarcasm datasets using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting for both binary sarcasm detection and explanation generation.

Result: Current models achieve moderate success in binary sarcasm detection but struggle to generate high-quality explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Conclusion: While VLMs show promise for multimodal sarcasm detection, they require further development and task-specific training to generate satisfactory explanations that highlight visual-textual incongruities.

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

*Aurelie Leribaux,Rafael Oyamada,Johannes De Smedt,Zahra Dasht Bozorgi,Artem Polyvyanyy,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Incorporating actor behavior as time series features improves throughput time forecasting in predictive process monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Processes are resource-driven and understanding actor behavior is crucial for accurate forecasting, but current research has limited incorporation of actor behavior as time-varying signals.

Method: Constructed multivariate time series with throughput time and actor-centric features (involvement, continuation frequency, interruption frequency, handover frequency, behavior duration), then trained and compared multiple models.

Result: Actor-enriched models consistently outperformed baseline models (only TT features) across RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics.

Conclusion: Modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating it into forecasting models enhances performance indicator predictions.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

### [40] [Improving Knowledge Graph Embeddings through Contrastive Learning with Negative Statements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11868)
*Rita T. Sousa,Heiko Paulheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel dual-model embedding approach that integrates explicitly declared negative statements into knowledge graph embedding learning, improving predictive performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing knowledge graph embedding methods rely on Closed World or Local Closed World assumptions, treating missing triples as false, which contrasts with the Open World Assumption in real-world knowledge graphs. Explicit negative statements are rarely included and overlooked during training.

Method: A dual-model architecture where two embedding models are trained in parallel - one on positive statements and another on negative statements. Each model generates negative samples by corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored by the other model.

Result: Extensive experiments on general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge graphs show improved predictive performance in link prediction and triple classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art embedding models.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge into embedding learning, enhancing the performance of knowledge graph embedding methods.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

*Xiaohang Tang,Zhuowen Cheng,Satyabrat Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CART is the first framework to enhance Decision Transformer's adversarial robustness in stochastic games by modeling interactions as stage games with NashQ values, achieving better worst-case performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods based on sequence modeling (like Decision Transformer) remains largely unexplored, despite their expressive power for sequential decision-making.

Method: Formulates protagonist-adversary interactions as stage games with payoffs defined as expected maximum value over subsequent states, then conditions Transformer policies on NashQ values derived from these games.

Result: Empirically achieves more accurate minimax value estimation and consistently superior worst-case returns across various adversarial stochastic games.

Conclusion: CART successfully generates policies that are simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to transition uncertainty in adversarial environments.

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes replicable clustering algorithms for statistical k-medians, k-means, and k-centers problems that produce identical partitions across executions when internal randomness is shared, with O(1)-approximation guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for replicable clustering algorithms that consistently produce the same results when run multiple times on different samples from the same distribution, building on the replicability framework introduced by Impagliazzo et al.

Method: Develop replicable algorithms by utilizing approximation routines for combinatorial clustering problems in a black-box manner, with different approaches for k-medians/k-means (polynomial sample complexity) and k-centers (exponential sample complexity with additive error).

Result: Achieved replicable O(1)-approximation for statistical Euclidean k-medians and k-means with poly(d) sample complexity, and O(1)-approximation with O(1)-additive error for k-centers with exp(d) sample complexity. Experimental validation on synthetic 2D distributions using sklearn's k-means++ implementation.

Conclusion: The work successfully demonstrates the feasibility of designing replicable clustering algorithms with provable approximation guarantees, though with different complexity trade-offs for different clustering objectives.

Abstract: We design replicable algorithms in the context of statistical clustering
under the recently introduced notion of replicability from Impagliazzo et al.
[2022]. According to this definition, a clustering algorithm is replicable if,
with high probability, its output induces the exact same partition of the
sample space after two executions on different inputs drawn from the same
distribution, when its internal randomness is shared across the executions. We
propose such algorithms for the statistical $k$-medians, statistical $k$-means,
and statistical $k$-centers problems by utilizing approximation routines for
their combinatorial counterparts in a black-box manner. In particular, we
demonstrate a replicable $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for statistical
Euclidean $k$-medians ($k$-means) with $\operatorname{poly}(d)$ sample
complexity. We also describe an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm with an
additional $O(1)$-additive error for statistical Euclidean $k$-centers, albeit
with $\exp(d)$ sample complexity. In addition, we provide experiments on
synthetic distributions in 2D using the $k$-means++ implementation from sklearn
as a black-box that validate our theoretical results.

*Chenliang Li,Junyu Leng,Jiaxiang Li,Youbang Sun,Shixiang Chen,Shahin Shahrampour,Alfredo Garcia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaRL is a bi-level optimization framework that improves robust RL by adaptively adjusting policy rank to match task complexity, avoiding nested min-max optimization while maintaining robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust RL methods use computationally expensive nested min-max optimization that yields overly conservative policies, creating a need for more efficient and less conservative approaches.

Method: Bi-level optimization with lower-level policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints using dynamics from Wasserstein ball, and upper-level adaptive rank adjustment to balance bias-variance trade-off.

Result: Outperforms fixed-rank baselines (SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (RNAC, Parseval) on MuJoCo benchmarks, converging toward intrinsic task rank.

Conclusion: Adaptive low-rank policy representations provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model uncertainty.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

*Alkis Kalavasis,Amin Karbasi,Kasper Green Larsen,Grigoris Velegkas,Felix Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents efficient replicable algorithms for learning large-margin halfspaces, improving upon previous work by Impagliazzo et al. [2022]. It introduces the first dimension-independent replicable algorithms that run in polynomial time, are proper, and achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to accuracy parameter ε. The work also explores trade-offs between sample/time complexity and introduces algorithms with exponential running times for improved sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon existing replicable algorithms for learning large-margin halfspaces by developing more efficient methods with better sample complexity and running time characteristics, addressing limitations in previous approaches.

Method: The paper develops multiple algorithms: 1) A polynomial-time dimension-independent replicable algorithm with optimal ε-dependence, 2) An SGD-based replicable algorithm for better sample/time complexity in certain regimes, 3) Algorithms using DP-to-Replicability reduction for improved margin parameter τ dependence, and 4) An improved algorithm with exponential running time but better overall sample complexity.

Result: The authors achieve several key results: first dimension-independent replicable algorithms for large-margin halfspaces running in polynomial time, optimal sample complexity with respect to ε, improved sample complexity over previous work across all relevant parameters, and trade-offs between sample complexity and running time through different algorithmic approaches.

Conclusion: The paper successfully develops multiple replicable algorithms for learning large-margin halfspaces that significantly improve upon prior work, offering various trade-offs between computational efficiency and sample complexity, with some algorithms achieving optimal or near-optimal performance in different parameter regimes.

Abstract: We provide efficient replicable algorithms for the problem of learning
large-margin halfspaces. Our results improve upon the algorithms provided by
Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell [STOC, 2022]. We design the first
dimension-independent replicable algorithms for this task which runs in
polynomial time, is proper, and has strictly improved sample complexity
compared to the one achieved by Impagliazzo et al. [2022] with respect to all
the relevant parameters. Moreover, our first algorithm has sample complexity
that is optimal with respect to the accuracy parameter $\epsilon$. We also
design an SGD-based replicable algorithm that, in some parameters' regimes,
achieves better sample and time complexity than our first algorithm. Departing
from the requirement of polynomial time algorithms, using the
DP-to-Replicability reduction of Bun, Gaboardi, Hopkins, Impagliazzo, Lei,
Pitassi, Sorrell, and Sivakumar [STOC, 2023], we show how to obtain a
replicable algorithm for large-margin halfspaces with improved sample
complexity with respect to the margin parameter $\tau$, but running time doubly
exponential in $1/\tau^2$ and worse sample complexity dependence on $\epsilon$
than one of our previous algorithms. We then design an improved algorithm with
better sample complexity than all three of our previous algorithms and running
time exponential in $1/\tau^{2}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in unified modeling of personal and relational user events by introducing datasets and a unified formalization, showing benefits of combining both event types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User event modeling typically separates personal events (modeled as sequences) and relational events (modeled as graphs), but real-world systems need both. Prior work rarely considers them together due to convenient simplifications.

Method: Introduces a collection of datasets that incorporate both personal and relational events, proposes a unified formalization for modeling both event types together.

Result: Empirical results show that models benefit from incorporating both personal and relational events, with current methods leaving notable room for improvements.

Conclusion: The resources are released to support further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this direction.

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks causal discovery algorithms' performance under model assumption violations, finding that differentiable methods show robustness in most scenarios except scale variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in real-world data, limiting their practical application. The authors aim to empirically test how these algorithms perform when their underlying assumptions are violated.

Method: The authors extensively benchmark various mainstream causal discovery algorithms that assume i.i.d. data under eight different model assumption violations. They evaluate performance using Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance metrics.

Result: Differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale variation. The authors also provide theoretical explanations for the performance of differentiable methods.

Conclusion: This work provides comprehensive benchmarking of differentiable causal discovery methods under model assumption violations, establishes standards for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, and aims to promote broader application in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: VMoGE is a novel method that uses variational mixture of graph neural experts to improve dementia diagnosis and staging by analyzing EEG data across specific frequency bands, achieving superior performance and interpretable biomarker insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG-based methods for dementia diagnosis use full-band frequency analysis, which limits precise differentiation between dementia subtypes like Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia, as well as severity stages.

Method: VMoGE integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification with structured variational inference, using a multi-granularity transformer for multi-scale temporal pattern extraction across four frequency bands, followed by variational graph convolutional encoding with Gaussian Markov Random Field priors.

Result: VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over state-of-the-art methods on two datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging.

Conclusion: The method provides interpretable insights through expert weights correlated with clinical indicators and spatial patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

*Nayan Sanjay Bhatia,Pranay Kocheta,Russell Elliott,Harikrishna S. Kuttivelil,Katia Obraczka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Locaris is a decoder-only LLM for indoor Wi-Fi localization that treats AP measurements as tokens, enabling direct processing of raw Wi-Fi data without pre-processing. It achieves sub-meter accuracy with minimal calibration and maintains robust performance across different devices and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional indoor Wi-Fi positioning methods require extensive calibration and suffer from performance degradation due to environmental changes, device heterogeneity, and channel variations. There's a need for calibration-free, scalable solutions that can handle raw Wi-Fi telemetry directly.

Method: Fine-tune a decoder-only large language model (LLM) on Wi-Fi datasets, treating each access point measurement as a token. This allows the model to ingest raw Wi-Fi telemetry without pre-processing and learn a lightweight mapping from signals to location.

Result: Locaris matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods across various telemetry types, achieves sub-meter accuracy with few hundred samples, maintains high accuracy with few-shot adaptation to unseen devices and scenarios, and shows robust performance under missing APs.

Conclusion: Compact LLMs can serve as effective calibration-free regression models for indoor localization, offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous Wi-Fi deployments, making them practical for real-world large-scale deployments where extensive calibration is infeasible.

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

*Junsoo Oh,Wei Huang,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mamba achieves efficient in-context learning through test-time feature extraction, outperforming linear Transformers and matching nonlinear Transformers' performance while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Mamba's strong empirical performance and computational efficiency, there is limited theoretical understanding of its underlying mechanisms, particularly its in-context learning capabilities.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Mamba's ICL capability using single-index models, proving that gradient-based pretraining enables test-time feature learning to extract relevant directions from context examples.

Result: Mamba achieves improved test-time sample complexity compared to linear Transformers and comparable performance to nonlinear Transformers, surpassing the CSQ lower bound and approaching information-theoretically optimal rates.

Conclusion: Mamba's nonlinear gating mechanism is crucial for feature extraction, enabling both computational efficiency and high performance in in-context learning tasks.

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

### [50] [Sample-Efficient Omniprediction for Proper Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12769)
*Isaac Gibbs,Ryan J. Tibshirani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of creating probabilistic predictions that enable accurate decisions for multiple downstream users, focusing on omniprediction where a single predictor minimizes multiple loss functions simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to design optimal predictors that work well for multiple decision makers with different utility functions, going beyond single-user prediction optimization to handle diverse downstream applications.

Method: The paper analyzes two existing approaches: 1) boosting methods using multicalibration, and 2) adversarial game-based methods. It then proposes an improved unrandomized algorithm that leverages structural properties of proper loss functions.

Result: The paper establishes that multicalibration is strictly harder than omniprediction, leading to suboptimal sample complexity. It develops a more direct, sample-efficient algorithm that avoids the complexity of randomized predictors from online-to-batch conversion.

Conclusion: The research provides theoretical insights into the relationship between multicalibration and omniprediction, and offers a practical unrandomized algorithm that efficiently handles multiple proper losses for downstream decision-making applications.

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

TL;DR: Three efficient restart paradigms for model-free non-stationary RL that address issues of complete forgetting and scheduled restarts in existing algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete forgetting of learned information after restarts, and (2) rigid scheduled restarts regardless of policy-environment compatibility.

Method: Proposed three restart approaches: partial, adaptive, and selective restarts, applied to modify RestartQ-UCB and RANDOMIZEDQ algorithms.

Result: Achieved near-optimal empirical performance across multiple environments, reducing dynamic regret by up to 91% compared to RestartQ-UCB.

Conclusion: The proposed restart paradigms significantly improve performance in non-stationary RL by addressing key limitations in existing restart mechanisms.

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient Turing computability implies existence of compositionally sparse DAG representations and neural approximants that achieve target precision through bounded-fan-in Boolean circuits and deep networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish connections between computational efficiency, sparse representations, and neural network approximation capabilities, particularly relating efficient computability to compositional approximation rates.

Method: Show that if a function is computable in polynomial time in bit-depths, then for any precision pair there exists a bounded-fan-in Boolean circuit of polynomial size/depth computing the discretized map, which can be converted to deep networks by replacing gates with neural emulators.

Result: Achieves accuracy ε=2^{-m_out} with deep networks of polynomial size/depth relative to input/output precisions, establishing connections to compositional approximation rates and optimization as hierarchical search.

Conclusion: Efficient Turing computability guarantees the existence of sparse compositional representations and corresponding neural approximants that can achieve desired precision through polynomial-size networks.

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

### [53] [Cautious Weight Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402)
*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Kaizhao Liang,Baiyu Su,Cong Xie,Nuo Wang Pierse,Chen Liang,Ni Lao,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) is a simple optimizer modification that applies weight decay only to parameters whose signs match the optimizer update direction, preserving the original loss function while enabling better convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard weight decay methods implicitly modify the objective function through regularization or constraints, which can alter the optimization landscape. The authors aim to develop a weight decay approach that maintains the original loss function while improving convergence behavior.

Method: CWD applies weight decay selectively - only to parameter coordinates where the sign of the parameter matches the sign of the optimizer update. This one-line modification works with any optimizer (AdamW, Lion, Muon) without requiring new hyperparameters or additional tuning.

Result: Experiments on language model pre-training and ImageNet classification show that CWD consistently improves final loss and accuracy across models ranging from millions to billions of parameters.

Conclusion: CWD provides an effective, drop-in replacement for standard weight decay that preserves the original optimization objective while enabling better convergence to locally Pareto-optimal stationary points.

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

TL;DR: The paper reveals that KL divergence in VAEs fails to enforce disentangled representations and introduces a Programmable Prior Framework using MMD to achieve state-of-the-art disentanglement without reconstruction trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure of KL-based regularizers in Variational Autoencoders to enforce disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation are captured by independent latent variables.

Method: Introduces the Programmable Prior Framework based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), which allows explicit control over latent space structure and uses a novel Latent Predictability Score (LPS) to quantify entanglement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art mutual independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the common reconstruction trade-off, and enables engineering of sophisticated priors that improve alignment with semantically meaningful features.

Conclusion: Provides a foundational tool for representation engineering that opens new avenues for model identifiability and causal reasoning by overcoming the limitations of traditional KL-based approaches.

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

*Beibu Li,Qichao Shentu,Yang Shu,Hui Zhang,Ming Li,Ning Jin,Bin Yang,Chenjuan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrossAD is a novel time series anomaly detection framework that incorporates cross-scale associations and cross-window modeling to capture dynamic multi-scale patterns and comprehensive contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for time series anomaly detection often model multi-scale information independently or use simple fusion strategies, failing to capture dynamic cross-scale associations during anomalies. Additionally, fixed sliding window approaches limit the ability to capture comprehensive contextual information.

Method: Proposed CrossAD framework with cross-scale reconstruction that reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series to explicitly capture cross-scale associations. Also designed a query library and incorporated global multi-scale context to overcome fixed window size limitations.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate CrossAD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: CrossAD successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by explicitly modeling cross-scale associations and incorporating global multi-scale context, achieving superior anomaly detection performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Y-shaped generative flows that move probability mass along shared pathways before branching to specific endpoints, using a novel velocity-powered transport cost with sublinear exponent to encourage joint mass movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern continuous-time generative models exhibit V-shaped transport where samples travel independently along straight trajectories, missing shared structure in the data.

Method: Proposed Y-shaped generative flows with velocity-powered transport cost (sublinear exponent 0-1) that rewards joint mass movement, implemented as a scalable neural ODE training objective.

Result: Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure on synthetic, image, and biology datasets, improve distributional metrics over flow-based baselines, and require fewer integration steps.

Conclusion: Y-shaped flows provide a more efficient and structured approach to generative modeling by leveraging shared transport pathways before target-specific branching.

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MosaicDiff is a novel framework that aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration through trajectory-aware structural pruning, achieving significant speed-ups without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior diffusion acceleration methods have overlooked the distinct learning speed phases during pretraining, creating a disconnect between training dynamics and sampling efficiency.

Method: Uses trajectory-aware structural pruning that adapts pruning strategy based on pretraining phases: conservative pruning for fast-learning middle stages and aggressive pruning for slow-learning early/late stages.

Result: Achieves significant sampling speed-ups on DiT and SDXL models while maintaining output quality, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins.

Conclusion: Provides a new viewpoint for efficient and robust training-free diffusion acceleration by harmonizing model's inner training dynamics with accelerated sampling process.

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Motivation: To understand how the topological structure of ReLU neural network activation patterns relates to decision boundaries and training behavior, providing geometric insights into neural network function.

Method: Analyze polytope decomposition of feature space induced by ReLU networks, investigate Fiedler partition of dual graph for binary classification, and compute homology of cellular decomposition for regression tasks.

Result: Fiedler partition appears to correlate with decision boundaries in binary classification, and similar patterns emerge between training loss and polyhedral cell-count during model training in regression.

Conclusion: Topological analysis reveals meaningful geometric relationships between neural network activation patterns and their functional behavior, with Fiedler partitions correlating with decision boundaries and homology patterns mirroring training dynamics.

Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network
activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU

space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition
of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the

similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer interpretability methods lack a mathematical framework to mechanistically model how layers facilitate state transitions during inference. The probabilistic nature of language models parallels quantum mechanics, inspiring a cross-disciplinary approach.

Method: Convert Transformer latent activations into state vectors in Hilbert space derived from output units. Reformulate hidden layers as unitary operators and Hamiltonians. Apply Born rule with measurement operator to obtain final probability distribution.

Result: Conducted proof-of-concept by probing a toy Transformer to investigate individual layer influence on prediction trajectory, demonstrating QLENS's potential for mechanistic understanding.

Conclusion: QLENS provides a foundation for cross-domain insights from physics to enhance Transformer understanding, offering a novel mathematical framework for modeling layer transitions during inference.

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CW-DPO is a two-stage alignment method for vision-language models that uses gentle negatives in supervised finetuning followed by preference optimization with cooling-weighted negative scaling to stabilize training and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference-based finetuning of VLMs is brittle due to uninformative gradients from trivially wrong negatives that destabilize training. The paper aims to address this by modeling and exploiting training dynamics.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage 1 performs supervised finetuning with gentle negatives (low-weight smoothed supervision). Stage 2 applies DPO with cooling-weighted negative scaling based on average token log-probability, using on-policy and mixed negatives.

Result: CW-DPO yields more stable optimization, better calibration, higher pairwise win-rates than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while converging in fewer steps across diverse VLM tasks.

Conclusion: Smoothing learning dynamics before cooling preferences is a simple, general principle for robust VLM alignment, with the cooling-weight mechanism being the primary driver of performance gains.

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

It identifies phase transitions in recurrent networks and proposes a biologically plausible supervised learning algorithm that maps inputs to fixed points using local plasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how biological neural networks achieve robust, sample-efficient learning without backpropagation, and to bridge the gap between contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by exploring how neural dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning.

Method: Using statistical mechanics tools to analyze dynamical attractors in random asymmetric recurrent networks, deriving conditions for fixed point emergence. Proposes a biologically plausible algorithm where inputs are mapped to fixed points via relaxation under external stimuli and stabilization through local plasticity.

Result: Identified a phase transition in fixed point structure based on self-coupling strength. The proposed algorithm successfully learns entangled MNIST, develops hierarchical representations with depth, increases hetero-association capacity, and works with various architectures.

Conclusion: The study reveals a strong connection between algorithm performance and the discovered phase transition, and suggests cortex-inspired alternatives to self-couplings for enabling this learning mechanism, providing insights into biologically plausible alternatives to backpropagation.

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

*Conor Rowan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exact second-order methods using true Hessian matrices fail in neural network training, challenging the common belief that loss landscapes are filled with local minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why exact second-order optimization methods (using true Hessian) fail in neural network training, despite theoretical advantages over first-order methods and quasi-Newton approaches.

Method: Analysis of neural network training using exact curvature information (true Hessian) compared to quasi-Newton methods that approximate the Hessian.

Result: Neural network training reliably fails when using exact Hessian information, revealing insights about the geometry of nonlinear discretizations and stationary point distribution.

Conclusion: The failure of exact second-order methods questions the conventional wisdom about loss landscapes being replete with local minima and provides new understanding of neural network optimization geometry.

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

*Yi-Chung Chen,David I. Inouye,Jing Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel generative classifier using visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling as an alternative to computationally expensive diffusion-based methods, achieving better accuracy-speed trade-off and offering unique properties like visual explainability and resistance to catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative classifiers are dominated by diffusion-based models which have high computational costs limiting scalability, and this narrow focus restricts understanding of generative classifiers' broader capabilities.

Method: Develops Adaptive VAR Classifier+ (A-VARC+) based on visual autoregressive modeling, which provides tractable likelihood and enables efficient classification with improved inference speed.

Result: Achieves superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed compared to diffusion-based methods, demonstrates visual explainability through token-wise mutual information, and shows inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning.

Conclusion: VAR-based generative classifiers offer a practical alternative to diffusion methods with unique advantages including computational efficiency, explainability, and robustness in incremental learning scenarios.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

*Sangmin Jo,Jee Seok Yoon,Wootaek Jeong,Kwanseok Oh,Heung-Il Suk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MEASURE, a novel domain generalization framework for sleep staging that reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for sleep staging struggle with generalization on unseen subjects due to physiological signal variability. Existing contrastive learning methods fail to adequately extract domain-invariant representations as they don't explicitly address domain characteristics in unshared information.

Method: Proposes MEASURE (Multi-scalE minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework that mitigates domain-relevant attributes while preserving essential temporal and spectral features across multiple feature levels for sleep stage classification.

Result: The method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in exhaustive experiments on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets SleepEDF-20 and MASS.

Conclusion: MEASURE effectively reduces domain-relevant information while maintaining essential features for sleep stage classification, demonstrating superior performance in domain generalization scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our

### [65] [Influence Dynamics and Stagewise Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12071)
*Jin Hwa Lee,Matthew Smith,Maxwell Adam,Jesse Hoogland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a stagewise data attribution framework that treats influence between samples as dynamic rather than static, showing influence patterns change non-monotonically during neural network training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TDA methods assume static influence patterns, but neural networks learn in distinct stages with changing influence dynamics that existing methods cannot capture.

Method: Developed a stagewise data attribution framework based on singular learning theory, validated predictions analytically and empirically in toy models, then demonstrated at scale in language models.

Result: Influence changes non-monotonically with sign flips and sharp peaks at developmental transitions; dynamic influence shifts map to progressive learning of semantic hierarchies; token-level influence changes align with known developmental stages in language models.

Conclusion: Influence patterns in neural networks are dynamic and stage-dependent, with non-monotonic changes that reflect the model's progressive learning process, requiring stagewise rather than static attribution methods.

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

*Heng Zhang,Tianyi Zhang,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Yaomin Shen,Haochen You,Zijian Zhang,Yilei Yuan,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphShaper is a geometry-aware framework that addresses performance degradation at structural boundaries in graph foundation models by using multi-geometric specialization with expert networks and adaptive fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph foundation models using contrastive learning with LLMs suffer significant performance degradation (over 20% accuracy loss) at structural boundaries due to conflicting geometric constraints from different topological patterns that cannot be resolved in a single Euclidean space.

Method: GraphShaper employs expert networks tailored to different geometric spaces (hyperbolic for tree structures, spherical for cyclic patterns) and dynamically computes fusion weights to adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural characteristics before alignment with text embeddings.

Result: GraphShaper achieves 9.47% accuracy improvements on citation networks and 7.63% on social networks in zero-shot settings compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the geometric diversity challenge in graph structures by respecting intrinsic geometric properties through multi-geometric specialization and adaptive fusion, significantly improving performance at structural boundaries.

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H4G addresses the over-abstraction problem in zero-shot graph learning by reducing hyperbolic embedding radii to preserve fine-grained structural patterns, achieving significant performance improvements on both heterophilic and homophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for text-attributed graphs struggle with fine-grained pattern recognition on heterophilic graphs due to an over-abstraction problem where multi-scale structural information is compressed into uniform high-level abstractions, causing information loss.

Method: Proposes H4G framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable block-diagonal scaling matrices and Möbius matrix multiplication to restore access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global receptive ability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with 12.8% improvement on heterophilic graphs and 8.4% on homophilic graphs, demonstrating that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation.

Conclusion: Radius reduction in hyperbolic space is essential for preserving fine-grained structural details and advancing zero-shot graph learning performance.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic sparse training strategies provide module-specific benefits that complement architectural improvements in deep reinforcement learning, leading to the development of Module-Specific Training (MST) framework for substantial scalability gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Larger neural networks often degrade performance in deep reinforcement learning due to optimization pathologies like plasticity loss, and existing dynamic training approaches have limitations including uniform strategies across different modules, limited evaluation on basic architectures, and lack of systematic comparison between different dynamic approaches.

Method: Comprehensive investigation across modules and architectures, comparing different dynamic approaches (sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, sparse-to-dense), and developing Module-Specific Training (MST) framework that exploits benefits of architectural improvements without algorithmic modifications.

Result: Dynamic sparse training strategies provide module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation established by architectural improvements, with MST demonstrating substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms.

Conclusion: Module-Specific Training (MST) framework effectively combines dynamic sparse training strategies with architectural improvements to achieve significant scalability gains in deep reinforcement learning without requiring algorithmic modifications.

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

*Aakash Lahoti,Tanya Marwah,Ratish Puduppully,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chimera is a unified model that incorporates data topology directly using state space models, eliminating the need for domain-specific inductive biases like position embeddings. It achieves strong performance across language, vision, and graph domains while offering algorithmic optimizations for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer methods treat data as unordered sets, ignoring neighborhood structure and requiring task-specific inductive biases (position embeddings, random walks) that require significant effort and can hinder generalization.

Method: Generalize state space models (which naturally don't require position embeddings) to capture any graph topology. Proposes algorithmic optimizations: linear-time recurrence for DAGs and mathematical relaxation for general graphs to achieve quadratic complexity.

Result: Outperforms BERT on GLUE by 0.7 points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph Benchmark.

Conclusion: Data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities, and Chimera validates that directly incorporating topology in a principled way removes the need for domain-specific biases while achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

TL;DR: nuGPR is a new framework that significantly reduces the computational cost of Gaussian Process Regression training using numerical linear algebra techniques, preconditioned conjugate gradient methods, data clustering for matrix structure exploitation, low-rank approximations, numerical gradients for hyperparameter optimization, and GPU parallelization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the well-known challenge of high computation cost associated with GPR training, which limits its practical application despite its inherent uncertainty measurement capabilities.

Method: Combines several numerical linear algebra techniques: preconditioned conjugate gradient for linear solves, data clustering to identify block-diagonal covariance matrix structure, low-rank approximations of off-diagonal blocks, numerical gradients for hyperparameter optimization instead of exact differentiation, and CUDA-based GPU parallelization.

Result: nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up to 12x compared to the best existing GPU-based GPR implementation on various synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed nuGPR framework successfully addresses the computational challenges of GPR training through an integrated approach of numerical optimization techniques and GPU acceleration, making GPR more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRACE is a novel graph few-shot learning framework that addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating adaptive spectrum experts and cross-set distribution calibration to handle local structural heterogeneity and distribution shifts between support and query sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph few-shot learning methods use fixed spectral operations that don't account for local topological heterogeneity, and assume support and query sets come from the same distribution, which leads to suboptimal generalization with limited labeled data.

Method: GRACE integrates adaptive spectrum experts to handle local structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration techniques to address distribution shifts between support and query sets.

Result: The framework theoretically enhances model generalization and empirically outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various experimental settings.

Conclusion: GRACE effectively addresses key limitations in graph few-shot learning by adapting to local structural variations and calibrating cross-set distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

*Harsh Kasyap,Minghong Fang,Zhuqing Liu,Carsten Maple,Somanath Tripathy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an intentional fairness attack in federated learning where a malicious client sends biased models that increase fairness loss while maintaining global accuracy, making the attack hard to detect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning provides data independence but becomes susceptible to poisoning attacks and bias propagation, even with homogeneous data distribution.

Method: The attack involves a client maliciously sending biased models by solving an optimization problem to increase fairness loss for metrics like demographic parity and equalized odds, while maintaining global accuracy.

Result: The attack increases bias up to 90% even with a single malicious client, and remains effective against state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes across different datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed fairness attack is insidious and hard to detect, demonstrating significant vulnerability in federated learning systems despite existing defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

*Ali Parsaee,Bei Jiang,Zachary Friggstad,Russell Greiner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores budgeted learning for survival datasets with censored instances, where learners can pay to acquire partial or complete labels for censored data points, providing theoretical bounds and empirical improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised learning assumes fully labeled datasets, but real-world survival data often contains censored instances where only lower bounds on time-to-event are known. Budgeted learning allows strategic allocation of resources to acquire additional information from censored instances, modeling realistic data collection scenarios where follow-up doesn't always lead to complete uncensoring.

Method: The authors apply state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data, allowing learners to pay for partial labeling of censored instances (e.g., acquiring actual time values or additional time information). The approach provides theoretical bounds and has time complexity asymptotically equivalent to BatchBALD, a standard active learning method.

Result: Empirical analysis on several survival tasks demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms other potential approaches on multiple benchmarks. The method provides performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to existing active learning techniques.

Conclusion: Budgeted learning is effectively applicable to survival datasets with censored instances, offering a practical framework for real-world data collection scenarios where complete labeling is costly or impossible. The approach achieves better performance than alternative methods while maintaining theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a minimalistic reasoning framework for small transformers that supports self-verifying reflection, showing that even tiny models can achieve LLM-level performance in tasks like integer multiplication and Sudoku through self-verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reflection contributes to empirical improvements in reasoning, given recent findings that LLMs detect limited errors in chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), and to analyze this issue with analytic clarity and reduced experimental costs.

Method: Developed a minimalistic reasoning framework supporting basic self-verifying reflection for small transformers without natural language, with theoretical proofs that self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are bounded.

Result: Tiny transformers with only a few million parameters benefit from self-verification in both training and reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer multiplication and Sudoku. RL improves in-distribution performance but mainly optimizes shallow statistical patterns without reducing verification errors.

Conclusion: Integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently facilitates chain-of-thought reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

*Yiming Zhang,Chester Holtz,Gal Mishne,Alex Cloninger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical analysis of meta-learning-based sample reweighting for learning with noisy labels, identifying three training phases and proposing a lightweight surrogate method that outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning-based sample reweighting helps mitigate label noise but lacks theoretical understanding of its behavior and training dynamics, which limits optimization and practical deployment.

Method: The authors conduct rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting, identify three training phases, and propose a lightweight surrogate method using mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation to avoid expensive bi-level optimization.

Result: The method consistently outperforms strong reweighting/selection baselines across both synthetic and real noisy-label benchmarks, providing more stable performance.

Conclusion: Meta-reweighting operates through three distinct training phases driven by similarity-weighted coupling, and the proposed lightweight surrogate effectively addresses its limitations while maintaining strong performance on noisy-label tasks.

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

### [76] [DE3S: Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning for Medical Early Time-Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12214)
*Tao Xie,Zexi Tan,Haoyi Xiao,Binbin Sun,Yiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DE3S proposes a novel Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework for medical early time-series classification, addressing accuracy-earliness trade-offs through dual-enhancement strategies, soft shapelet sparsification, and dual-path architecture with MoE and Inception modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early time-series classification in medical applications like sepsis prediction is crucial but faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with existing methods struggling to capture subtle early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance.

Method: Three innovations: (1) dual-enhancement strategy combining temporal augmentation with attention-based global enhancement, (2) attention-score-based soft shapelet sparsification, and (3) dual-path Mixture of Experts Network and Inception modules fusion architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Conclusion: DE3S framework effectively addresses accuracy-earliness trade-offs in medical ETSC through precise shapelet learning and demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets.

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

*Hanru Bai,Weiyang Ding,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion enables one-step image generation while maintaining interpretable generative trajectories through linear operators in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-off between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, where traditional methods are slow but interpretable, while one-step methods are fast but lack control.

Method: Lifts nonlinear diffusion dynamics into latent space using Koopman operator theory, enabling globally linear evolution and closed-form solutions. Uses hierarchical architecture with scale-specific Koopman subspaces to model multi-scale image generation.

Result: Achieves competitive one-step generation performance while providing full access to intermediate states for manual intervention and interpretability through spectral analysis.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, enabling explainable image synthesis with both speed and control.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IMDGA is a human-centric adversarial attack framework that orchestrates multi-level perturbations across both graph structure and textual features in Graph-LLMs, demonstrating superior interpretability, effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-LLMs integrating large language models with graph neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks on both structural topology and textual attributes, but no unified approach exists to address both attack dimensions comprehensively.

Method: IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated modules to craft interpretable multi-dimensional attacks that perturb both graph structure and textual features, balancing interpretability and impact.

Result: Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: IMDGA exposes critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning and reveals an underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs, providing valuable insights for improving their resilience.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and

*Tao Yin,Xiaohong Zhang,Jiacheng Zhang,Li Huang,Zhibin Zhang,Yuansong Zeng,Jin Xie,Meng Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoRA introduces instance-specific low-rank adaptation for molecular graphs in LLMs, enabling dynamic parameter injection without fine-tuning to preserve general reasoning while capturing molecule-specific structural features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal alignment methods for molecular graphs have limitations: they use shared parameter spaces that cannot capture instance-specific structural features, and fine-tuning LLMs causes catastrophic forgetting of general reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA) that generates unique low-rank adaptation weights for each input molecular graph, which are dynamically injected into a frozen LLM without fine-tuning.

Result: MoRA outperforms static adaptation baselines with 14.1% relative improvement in reaction prediction exact match and 22% error reduction for quantum property prediction on key molecular tasks.

Conclusion: Instance-specific dynamic adaptation through MoRA effectively integrates molecular structures with LLMs while preserving core knowledge, demonstrating superior performance over static adaptation methods.

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

### [80] [Optimal Regularization for Performative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12249)
*Edwige Cyffers,Alireza Mirrokni,Marco Mondelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes performative learning where data distribution reacts to deployed models, showing that while performative effects worsen test risk in population settings, they can be beneficial in over-parameterized regimes. Optimal regularization scales with performative effect strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In performative learning, data distributions react to deployed models (e.g., strategic users gaming the system), creating complex dynamics beyond classical supervised learning. Models need to account for potential distribution shifts they might cause.

Method: The study explores regularization's impact in high-dimensional ridge regression to cope with performative effects, analyzing both population and over-parameterized regimes.

Result: Performative effects worsen test risk in population settings but can be beneficial in over-parameterized regimes where features exceed samples. Optimal regularization scales with performative effect strength, enabling anticipation-based regularization setting.

Conclusion: Regularization can effectively handle performative effects in learning, with optimal regularization parameters that scale with the strength of performative effects, as demonstrated through empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiLoRA is a training-free framework that performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools for domain generalization, achieving up to 55% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA reuse methods require explicit task labels or additional training, and activate fixed numbers of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy or insufficiency that degrades performance.

Method: HiLoRA defines rank-one components (ROCs) where each rank parameter is an independent unit. It adaptively selects LoRAs and determines ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at sequence level, then refines routing by activating only the most informative ROCs at token level.

Result: Extensive experiments show HiLoRA achieves substantial improvements in domain generalization with accuracy gains up to 55% over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable inference throughput.

Conclusion: HiLoRA provides an effective training-free framework for adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools with theoretical guarantees, significantly improving domain generalization performance.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

*Laurin Luttmann,Lin Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-agent self-improvement approach for Neural Combinatorial Optimization that predicts joint agent-task assignments and uses set-prediction loss to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, improving sample efficiency and coordination while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-improvement methods in NCO are computationally expensive and fail to exploit the structure of multi-agent combinatorial problems, particularly agent-permutation symmetries where different action sequences yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and coordinated behavior learning.

Method: The approach extends self-improvement to operate over joint multi-agent actions, using a model architecture that predicts complete agent-task assignments jointly at each step and employs a set-prediction loss to supervise on multiple expert assignments per state.

Result: Empirical validation on several combinatorial problems shows consistent improvements in final solution quality and significantly reduced generation latency compared to standard self-improvement methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent self-improvement framework with set-prediction loss effectively addresses computational inefficiency and coordination limitations in existing methods, demonstrating superior performance in both solution quality and generation speed.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

*Fei Ren,Sifan Wang,Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Hai-Sui Yu,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GFF-PIELM, a Fourier feature-enhanced physics-informed extreme learning machine that effectively solves high-frequency and variable-frequency PDEs while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PIELM struggles with PDEs involving high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors, necessitating a more robust approach that can handle diverse frequency components without sacrificing efficiency.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Integrate Fourier feature mapping as activation function in ELM, 2) Assign frequency coefficients to hidden neurons for capturing diverse frequency components, 3) Develop innovative initialization method for hyperparameters by monitoring ELM output weight distribution.

Result: GFF-PIELM significantly improves predictive accuracy for high-frequency, variable-frequency, multi-scale, irregular boundary, and inverse problems without increasing training time or architecture complexity, as demonstrated through five case studies with ten numerical examples.

Conclusion: PIELM can be effectively extended to solve challenging high-frequency and variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and the proposed initialization strategy may inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning frameworks.

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

TL;DR: DeepSPI extends safe policy improvement to online RL with world models and representation learning, ensuring monotonic improvement through constrained policy updates and achieving competitive performance on ALE-57.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safe policy improvement guarantees are limited to offline, tabular RL settings, creating a need for theoretical frameworks that work in online scenarios with deep learning components.

Method: Developed theoretical framework restricting policy updates to neighborhood of current policy, coupled with local transition/reward losses and regularized policy updates in DeepSPI algorithm.

Result: DeepSPI matches or exceeds performance of strong baselines (PPO, DeepMDPs) on ALE-57 benchmark while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The work successfully extends safe policy improvement theory to online deep RL settings, linking prediction losses to representation quality and providing practical algorithms with theoretical backing.

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

TL;DR: Novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks combined with extreme-value analysis techniques improve rainfall forecasting in Thailand, outperforming baselines and enhancing extreme-event prediction for water management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate rainfall forecasting, especially for extreme events, is challenging in climatology. Traditional machine learning models have limitations in predicting extremes, and there's a need for improved methods that capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while offering explainability.

Method: Uses physics-informed Graph Neural Networks with graph-structured representation of gauge stations. Combines Graph Attention Network with LSTM layers, using attention mechanism with edge features from orographic-precipitation physics. Applies Peak-Over-Threshold mapping with Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution method for extreme value analysis.

Result: The method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including extreme-prone areas, and remains competitive with state-of-the-art. Compared to operational SEAS5 system, it improves extreme-event prediction and produces fine-resolution maps for decision-making.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-informed GNN approach with extreme-value analysis provides practical enhancement for rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, supporting long-term water management decisions through improved prediction accuracy and explainable teleconnections.

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm with evolving reward functions under Markovian sampling, achieving O(1/√T) convergence rate when rewards evolve slowly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many practical RL algorithms use evolving reward functions (reward shaping, entropy regularization, curriculum learning) but lack theoretical foundations. This work aims to provide theoretical guarantees for such algorithms.

Method: Analyzes a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm where reward parameters change at each time step, affecting both policy optimization and value estimation. Uses Markovian sampling and derives non-asymptotic bounds under standard assumptions.

Result: Shows that O(1/√T) convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate for static rewards, when reward parameters evolve slowly enough. Also improves distribution mismatch analysis by a factor of log²T in static-reward case.

Conclusion: The analysis provides theoretical foundation for popular RL techniques with evolving rewards, demonstrating that single-timescale actor-critic methods can maintain optimal convergence rates even with slowly changing reward functions.

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

*Donghwan Rho,Sieun Seo,Hyewon Sung,Chohong Min,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a TSP-based token reordering strategy and post-processing to enable encrypted text generation with LLMs using homomorphic encryption, addressing the challenge of next-token prediction while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As users increasingly interact with LLMs using private information, secure encrypted communication becomes essential. Homomorphic encryption enables computation on encrypted data, but text generation (particularly next-token prediction) remains a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction.

Method: Proposes a TSP-based token reordering strategy to address encrypted text generation difficulties, together with a post-processing step that further reduces approximation error.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and preserves data privacy throughout.

Conclusion: The contributions advance the feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference by enabling encrypted text generation while maintaining data privacy.

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

### [90] [Towards Cross-Modal Error Detection with Tables and Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12383)
*Olga Ovcharenko,Sebastian Schelter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks cross-modal error detection methods for tabular data, finding that Cleanlab and DataScope perform best when paired with AutoML, but current approaches remain limited for real-world heavy-tailed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional error detection methods focus on single modalities and miss cross-modal errors common in domains like e-commerce and healthcare where multiple data types coexist.

Method: Benchmarking four datasets with five baseline approaches including Cleanlab (label error detection) and DataScope (data valuation) paired with AutoML frameworks.

Result: Cleanlab and DataScope achieved the highest F1 scores when used with strong AutoML frameworks, but current methods show limitations with heavy-tailed real-world data.

Conclusion: Current cross-modal error detection methods are insufficient for real-world applications, motivating further research to address limitations with heavy-tailed data distributions.

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

### [91] [Enhanced Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks for Million-Scale Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12401)
*Shengyin Sun,Chen Ma,Jiehao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for pre-training GNNs on large-scale heterogeneous graphs that addresses semantic mismatch through structure-aware and semantic-aware pre-training tasks, using semantic neighbors to improve transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN pre-training methods are designed for homogeneous graphs and don't handle semantic mismatch between original data and ideal transferable data, while real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous.

Method: Two-stage pre-training: structure-aware task captures structural properties in heterogeneous graphs, and semantic-aware task constructs perturbation subspace with semantic neighbors to address semantic mismatch and improve transferability.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively pre-trains GNNs on heterogeneous graphs by addressing structural and semantic challenges, leading to better transferable knowledge for downstream tasks with limited labeled data.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

### [92] [Continuous Uniqueness and Novelty Metrics for Generative Modeling of Inorganic Crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12405)
*Masahiro Negishi,Hyunsoo Park,Kinga O. Mastej,Aron Walsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two continuous distance functions to evaluate generative AI models for inorganic crystals, addressing limitations of current distance metrics in quantifying similarity, distinguishing compositional vs structural differences, ensuring Lipschitz continuity, and providing permutation-invariant uniqueness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current crystal distance functions used to evaluate generative AI models for materials have four key limitations: they can't quantify similarity degrees, can't distinguish compositional from structural differences, lack Lipschitz continuity against atomic coordinate shifts, and produce non-invariant uniqueness metrics under sample permutation.

Method: The authors propose two continuous distance functions specifically designed to evaluate uniqueness and novelty in generative models for inorganic crystals, which theoretically overcome the limitations of traditional distance metrics.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed continuous distance functions reveal insights that are missed by traditional distance functions, providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals.

Conclusion: The proposed continuous distance functions offer a superior evaluation framework for generative AI models in materials science, overcoming fundamental limitations of existing metrics and enabling more accurate assessment of model performance in sampling chemical spaces for functional materials.

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

### [93] [Bayesian Optimization for Dynamic Pricing and Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12447)
*Anush Anand,Pranav Agrawal,Tejas Bodas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Gaussian Process-based nonparametric approach using Bayesian Optimization for dynamic pricing, outperforming traditional RL methods in revenue while requiring fewer assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dynamic pricing methods rely on parametric demand function assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting their applicability.

Method: Uses Gaussian Process-based Bayesian Optimization to treat demand as a black-box function, with tailored algorithms for both infinite and finite inventory settings.

Result: BO-based methods outperform state-of-the-art RL algorithms in revenue, require fewer assumptions, and offer greater robustness in experiments.

Conclusion: Bayesian Optimization is a powerful and practical tool for dynamic pricing in complex, uncertain environments, providing sample-efficient learning with regret guarantees.

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

### [94] [A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12451)
*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the conventional belief that flat minima correlate with better generalization, showing that sharper minima can actually emerge with regularization and coincide with improved performance across multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit the role of sharpness in model performance, questioning the established connection between flat minima and improved generalization given recent theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions.

Method: Conducted extensive empirical studies from single-objective optimization to modern image classification tasks, examining models with various regularizations (SAM, weight decay, data augmentation) and comparing sharp vs flat minima.

Result: Found that sharper minima often emerge when models are regularized and can coincide with better generalization, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Baselines without regularization tend to converge to flatter minima but perform worse across safety metrics.

Conclusion: Function complexity, rather than flatness alone, governs solution geometry, and sharper minima can reflect more appropriate inductive biases under regularization, calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

### [95] [Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12453)
*Viacheslav Vasilev,Arseny Ivanov,Nikita Gushchin,Maria Kovaleva,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TCVBM extends Bridge Matching to time-correlated video data by modeling inter-sequence dependencies, improving temporal coherence in video generation tasks like frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with data-to-data tasks between complex distributions, and existing Bridge Matching methods don't address temporal coherence in video data, which is critical for video generation and manipulation tasks.

Method: TCVBM extends Bridge Matching to time-correlated data sequences by explicitly modeling inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge and directly incorporating temporal correlations into the sampling process.

Result: TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple quantitative metrics compared to classical bridge matching and diffusion methods, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and reconstruction fidelity in video tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed TCVBM framework successfully addresses the temporal coherence limitation in video data generation by extending Bridge Matching to handle time-correlated sequences, providing better performance for video-related tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

*Yi Liu,Yang Liu,Leqian Zheng,Jue Hong,Junjie Shi,Qingyou Yang,Ye Wu,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PubSub-VFL is a novel Vertical Federated Learning paradigm that uses a Publisher/Subscriber architecture to address computational inefficiency and training latency in two-party collaborative learning, achieving 2-7x speedup and 91.07% resource utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Two-Party Split Learning (Vertical Federated Learning) suffers from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency due to synchronous dependency design, resource heterogeneity, and data heterogeneity among participants.

Method: Proposes PubSub-VFL with Publisher/Subscriber architecture that leverages decoupling capabilities and data parallelism to create hierarchical asynchronous mechanism. Also formalizes optimization problem based on system profiles to select optimal hyperparameters while preserving privacy.

Result: Achieves 2-7x training acceleration without accuracy loss, computational resource utilization up to 91.07%, stable convergence, and compatibility with security protocols like differential privacy. Validated on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL effectively addresses computational inefficiency and training latency in Vertical Federated Learning through its novel asynchronous architecture and optimization approach, significantly improving training speed and resource utilization while maintaining privacy and accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

### [97] [Mitigating the Noise Shift for Denoising Generative Models via Noise Awareness Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12497)
*Jincheng Zhong,Boyuan Jiang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'noise shift' - a misalignment between pre-defined noise levels and actual noise in diffusion models - and proposes Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG) to correct this issue, improving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing denoising models suffer from noise shift, where intermediate states during sampling don't match pre-defined noise levels, leading to sub-optimal generation due to out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates.

Method: Proposes Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG) to steer sampling trajectories to remain consistent with noise schedule, and introduces a classifier-free variant using noise-condition dropout to jointly train noise-conditional and noise-unconditional models.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet generation and supervised fine-tuning tasks show NAG consistently mitigates noise shift and substantially improves generation quality of mainstream diffusion models.

Conclusion: NAG effectively addresses the pervasive noise shift problem in diffusion models through explicit trajectory correction, leading to significant improvements in generation quality across various tasks.

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

*Ahmed Ben Yahmed,Hafedh El Ferchichi,Marc Abeille,Vianney Perchet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information where the goal is to maximize total cumulative reward while ensuring each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward across contexts, addressing fair revenue allocation in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses real-world applications requiring fair revenue allocation where contextual variation is inherent, capturing scenarios where minimum reward constraints must be satisfied across different contexts while maintaining overall performance.

Method: The authors design algorithms that either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce constraint satisfaction, addressing the technical challenges introduced by cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints.

Result: The paper derives problem-dependent upper bounds on both regret and constraint violations for each algorithm, and establishes a lower bound showing optimal dependence on the time horizon in their results.

Conclusion: The work reveals fundamental limitations of the free exploration principle used in prior research and demonstrates that the time horizon dependence in their results is optimal, providing insights into constrained multi-armed bandit problems with contextual information.

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection
of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as
energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.

TL;DR: This paper conducts an interview study to identify practical challenges hindering cross-silo federated learning adoption, revealing barriers related to model performance, incentives, and trust between organizations that differ from cross-device FL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite growing organizational interest in cross-silo federated learning driven by data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, its practical adoption remains limited, indicating unresolved challenges that need investigation.

Method: The researchers conducted an interview study spanning diverse stakeholders including user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers to uncover practical barriers to adoption.

Result: The study revealed various barriers including concerns about model performance, questions of incentives, and trust issues between participating organizations that are distinct from cross-device FL challenges.

Conclusion: Cross-silo FL faces unique practical challenges not well-captured by existing research, requiring future research directions to overcome these adoption barriers.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation functions more as a data-dependent regularizer with negative asymmetric payoff rather than a compression mechanism, with limited knowledge transfer and safety concerns due to negative knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the functional impact of knowledge distillation by quantifying its compression capacity and knowledge transfer mechanisms, decoupling compression from architectural reduction.

Method: Employed hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to analyze knowledge transfer across data modalities, using multiple distillation variants and analyzing distillation scaling laws across model sizes.

Result: Limited knowledge transfer observed across modalities and architectures, with consistent asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to students, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and more as a data-dependent regularizer with negative asymmetric payoff, based on findings from 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using pretrained Foundation Inference Models (FIMs) to decouple the problems of discovering coarse-grained variables and fitting governing equations in dynamical systems analysis, enabling more stable representation learning through a simulation-consistent loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional dynamical processes often evolve on low-dimensional manifolds, but existing machine learning approaches jointly solve variable discovery and equation fitting, which can be unstable. The authors aim to decouple these problems for more robust analysis.

Method: Leverage pretrained FIMs that estimate infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems in zero-shot mode. Freeze FIM weights and train only the encoder-decoder map, using a simulation-consistent loss to stabilize representation learning.

Result: A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion embedded in synthetic video data demonstrates the approach's potential for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

Conclusion: Decoupling variable discovery from dynamics fitting using FIMs provides a stable framework for identifying latent dynamics in high-dimensional systems, enabling efficient coarse-graining workflows.

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

*Yuta Kobayashi,Zilin Jing,Jiayu Yao,Hongseok Namkoong,Shalmali Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learning-to-Measure (L2M), a meta-learning approach for active feature acquisition that learns acquisition policies across multiple tasks without per-task retraining, using uncertainty quantification and conditional mutual information maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AFA methods are limited to single predetermined tasks and struggle with systematic missingness in features and limited labels. There's a need for scalable approaches that can learn across various tasks.

Method: L2M uses sequence-modeling pre-training for reliable uncertainty quantification and an uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional mutual information. It operates directly on datasets with retrospective missingness and performs meta-AFA in-context.

Result: L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines across synthetic and real-world tabular benchmarks, particularly under conditions of scarce labels and high missingness.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-AFA framework with L2M provides an effective solution for learning feature acquisition policies across multiple tasks, eliminating the need for per-task retraining while maintaining strong performance even with limited labels and high missingness.

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Laminar is a scalable RL post-training system that breaks global synchronization bottlenecks through trajectory-level asynchrony, achieving 5.48× throughput speedup on 1024-GPU clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL frameworks suffer from severe GPU underutilization due to extreme long-tail skewness in trajectory generation and rigid global weight synchronization between actors and rollouts.

Method: Proposes a fully decoupled architecture with relay workers for distributed parameter service and dynamic repack mechanism to consolidate long-tail trajectories, enabling asynchronous weight synchronization.

Result: Achieves up to 5.48× training throughput speedup over state-of-the-art systems on 1024-GPU clusters while reducing model convergence time.

Conclusion: Laminar's trajectory-level asynchrony and fully decoupled design effectively address scalability limitations in RL post-training, providing both efficiency and robustness for large-scale deployments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

*Arip Asadulaev,Fakhri Karray,Martin Takac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bellman Wasserstein Distance (BWD), a value-aware optimal transport metric that estimates offline RL dataset quality without training agents, and shows it strongly correlates with actual algorithm performance while also improving returns when used as a regularizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL datasets vary widely in quality but it's difficult to assess dataset quality a priori since data provenance and skill composition are unknown. Current methods require training agents to evaluate dataset quality.

Method: Proposes Bellman Wasserstein Distance (BWD) - a value-aware optimal transport score computed from a behavioral critic and state conditional OT formulation that measures how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.

Result: Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. When used as a regularizer during policy optimization, BWD explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves returns.

Conclusion: Value-aware, distributional signals like BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy optimization, providing an efficient way to estimate dataset quality without training agents.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A foundation model for event sequence analysis that learns from millions of simulated sequences and can analyze new datasets instantly without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML models require building and training from scratch for each new dataset, which is slow and costly. This approach aims to make sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerate scientific discovery.

Method: Train a single foundation model on millions of simulated event sequences to learn general patterns of how events unfold over time. The model can then analyze new scientific data instantly without retraining by looking at a few examples, or be quickly fine-tuned for higher accuracy.

Result: The model achieves instant analysis of new scientific datasets without requiring retraining, making it highly efficient and accessible for various scientific fields that rely on event sequence analysis.

Conclusion: This foundation model approach provides a powerful, general-purpose tool for event sequence analysis that eliminates the need for dataset-specific model development, thereby accelerating scientific discovery across multiple domains.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate data-driven modeling of dynamical systems as ODEs is challenging, especially with sparse or noisy data, which is common across natural sciences.

Method: The model uses a flexible neural operator trained on synthetic data to perform zero-shot ODE inference from sparse and noisy observations.

Result: FIM-ODE provides accurate ODE estimates comparable to state-of-the-art neural methods and enables qualitative comparison of estimated vector fields.

Conclusion: FIM-ODE demonstrates effective zero-shot ODE inference from sparse, noisy data using pretrained neural operators, offering a robust alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving
deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems
as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging,
especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation
Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs
zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

*Chih-Chuan Cheng,Yi-Ju Tseng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SG-XDEAT is a novel framework for supervised tabular data learning that uses dual-stream encoding with raw and target-conditioned representations, enhanced by cross-dimensional and cross-encoding attention mechanisms with adaptive sparse filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more robust deep learning model for tabular data by jointly modeling raw feature values and target-aware representations while adaptively filtering out noise.

Method: Uses dual-stream encoder with raw value and target-conditioned streams, hierarchical attention modules including cross-dimensional self-attention, cross-encoding self-attention, and adaptive sparse self-attention mechanism.

Result: Empirical results on multiple public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling raw and target-aware views with adaptive noise filtering yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper models have large sizes that hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, requiring methods to reduce computational requirements while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Uses Sparse Group LASSO penalty for structured sparsity to reduce FLOPs, proposes weight statistics aware pruning algorithm, and designs custom text normalizer for WER evaluation.

Result: Achieved 35.4% parameter reduction, 14.25% lower memory, and 18.5% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-small; 31% parameter reduction, 15.29% lower memory, and 16.95% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-medium; outperformed Iterative Magnitude Pruning by pruning 18.7% more parameters with 12.31 WER reduction.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully creates efficient Whisper variants suitable for edge devices while maintaining or improving speech recognition performance.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices. This paper proposes a framework to design fine-tuned variants of
Whisper which address the above problem. Structured sparsity is enforced via
the Sparse Group LASSO penalty as a loss regularizer, to reduce the number of
FLOating Point operations (FLOPs). Further, a weight statistics aware pruning
algorithm is proposed. We also design our custom text normalizer for WER
evaluation. On Common Voice 11.0 Hindi dataset, we obtain, without degrading
WER, (a) 35.4% reduction in model parameters, 14.25% lower memory consumption
and 18.5% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-small, and (b) 31% reduction in model
parameters, 15.29% lower memory consumption and 16.95% fewer FLOPs on
Whisper-medium; and, (c) substantially outperform the state-of-the-art
Iterative Magnitude Pruning based method by pruning 18.7% more parameters along
with a 12.31 reduction in WER.

### [110] [Structure-Aware Spectral Sparsification via Uniform Edge Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12669)
*Kaiwen He,Petros Drineas,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that uniform edge sampling, rather than importance sampling based on effective resistances, suffices for spectral clustering when graphs have well-separated k-clusters with large structure ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral clustering relies on eigenvector computation which doesn't scale well to massive graphs. Classical sparsification methods require expensive preprocessing to estimate effective resistances for importance sampling.

Method: The authors prove that uniform sampling of O(γ²n log n/ε²) edges preserves the spectral subspace for clustering, where γ is the Laplacian condition number. They introduce new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges and adapt matrix Chernoff bounds to the dominant eigenspace.

Result: For graphs with well-separated k-clustering (characterized by large structure ratio Υ(k) = λ_{k+1}/ρ_G(k)), uniform sampling preserves the spectral embedding and clustering quality without requiring importance sampling.

Conclusion: Under strong clusterability conditions, uniform edge sampling is structure-aware and sufficient for structure-preserving spectral clustering, connecting coreset-based clustering theory to spectral sparsification.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety guardrails through adversarial prompts, requiring effective protection methods.

Method: Uses Concept Alignment and Concept Manipulation (CALM) to modify latent representations in the last layer via orthogonal projection and CW technique from Computer Vision to remove harmful concept directions.

Result: CALM reduces harmful outputs and outperforms baseline methods in most metrics with minimal computational overhead at inference.

Conclusion: CALM provides a lightweight approach to AI safety that effectively suppresses harmful content without retraining, fine-tuning, or additional training data.

Abstract: Large Language Models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety guardrails (e.g., by tricking the model with adversarial
prompts). We propose Concept Alignment and Concept Manipulation \textbf{CALM},
an inference-time method that suppresses harmful concepts by modifying latent
representations of the last layer of the model, without retraining. Leveraging
\gls*{cw} technique from Computer Vision combined with orthogonal projection,
CALM removes unwanted latent directions associated with harmful content while
preserving model performance. Experiments show that CALM reduces harmful
outputs and outperforms baseline methods in most metrics, offering a
lightweight approach to AI safety with no additional training data or model
fine-tuning, while incurring only a small computational overhead at inference.

*Shouren Wang,Wang Yang,Xianxuan Long,Qifan Wang,Vipin Chaudhary,Xiaotian Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current hybrid thinking LLMs suffer from reasoning leakage into no-think mode. The paper identifies key factors for better controllability and proposes a training recipe that reduces no-think output length and reasoning tokens while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid thinking allows LLMs to balance efficiency and reasoning, but current implementations show incomplete mode separation where reasoning behaviors leak into no-think mode, compromising the intended efficiency benefits.

Method: Analyzed factors influencing controllability and identified four key factors: larger data scale, using think/no-think answers from different questions, moderate increase in no-think data, and two-phase training strategy. Proposed a practical training recipe based on these findings.

Result: The proposed recipe significantly reduces no-think output length (from 1085 to 585 on MATH500) and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens like "wait" (from 5917 to 522 on MATH500) while maintaining accuracy in both modes.

Conclusion: Current hybrid thinking has limitations in mode separation, but the identified factors and proposed training strategy can significantly improve controllability, offering directions for strengthening hybrid thinking capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

*Guo Qin,Zhi Chen,Yong Liu,Zhiyuan Shi,Haixuan Liu,Xiangdong Huang,Jianmin Wang,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoRA is a covariate-aware adaptation framework for Time Series Foundation Models that enhances forecasting by incorporating exogenous covariates from multiple modalities while preserving pre-trained backbone capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Time Series Foundation Models are typically pre-trained on univariate time series, missing crucial information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks, limiting their performance.

Method: CoRA uses frozen pre-trained foundation model backbones as feature extractors, employs Granger Causality Embedding to evaluate covariate predictability, and integrates weighted embeddings with zero-initialized condition-injection to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

Result: CoRA achieves 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with full or few-shot training samples, and shows strong compatibility with various TSFMs.

Conclusion: CoRA presents a practical paradigm for applying Time Series Foundation Models by effectively incorporating diverse covariates while maintaining model performance and compatibility.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

*Muhammad Ayub Sabir,Junbiao Pang,Jiaqi Wu,Fatima Ashraf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for abnormal stop detection in intercity coach transportation that addresses data sparsity and label scarcity through sparsity-aware segmentation, domain-specific indicators, graph-based label propagation, and self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abnormal stop detection is critical for passenger safety and operational reliability, but faces challenges from sparse GPS trajectories that obscure short stops and limited labeled data that restricts supervised learning. Existing methods assume dense sampling or regular patterns, limiting their applicability.

Method: Proposed SAS for sparsity-aware segmentation, three domain-specific indicators for abnormal stop behaviors, LTIGA for smoothing indicators via local similarity graphs, spatial-temporal graph construction with label propagation and GCN for relational learning, and self-training with pseudo-labels.

Result: Experiments on real-world coach data achieved AUC of 0.854 and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data sparsity and label scarcity in abnormal stop detection, demonstrating superior performance with minimal labeled data through innovative segmentation, graph-based learning, and self-training approaches.

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Motivation: To leverage chemical pretrained models and multitask learning to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints like on-target potency and ADMET properties, addressing the need for more accurate and efficient drug property prediction methods.

Method: Enhanced multitask finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models (KERMT and KGPT), comparing performance against non-pretrained models across different data sizes. Created multitask ADMET data splits for benchmarking and developed an accelerated KERMT implementation.

Result: Multitask finetuning of pretrained models significantly outperforms non-pretrained graph neural networks. The performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in multitask mode is most significant at larger data sizes. Released two multitask ADMET datasets and an accelerated KERMT implementation on GitHub.

Conclusion: Multitask finetuning of chemical pretrained models provides substantial performance gains for drug discovery applications, particularly with larger datasets. The released resources enable more accurate benchmarking and practical implementation in industrial drug discovery workflows.

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

*Dayin Gou,Sanghyun Byun,Nilesh Malpeddi,Gabrielle De Micheli,Prathamesh Vaste,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARVQ is a post-training compression method that combines Corrective Adaptor with group Residual Vector Quantization to compress LLM embedding layers to ~1.6 bits, reducing memory footprint for edge device deployment without requiring specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have large parameter sizes for token embedding, causing substantial storage requirements and memory footprints, especially problematic for memory-bound edge devices where reducing memory footprint can free bandwidth and speed up inference.

Method: Uses composition of linear and non-linear maps with group Residual Vector Quantization to mimic original model embedding, compressing to approximately 1.6 bits without needing specialized hardware for lower-bit storage.

Result: Tested on multiple LLMs (LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.2-3B, etc.) across generative, discriminative, math and reasoning tasks. Achieves lower average bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy compared to scalar quantization.

Conclusion: CARVQ provides a novel compression technique compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization, enabling efficient LLM deployment on memory-constrained edge devices by reducing memory footprint through 4-bit memory support.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit

### [118] [Improving Decision Trees through the Lens of Parameterized Local Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12726)
*Juha Harviainen,Frank Sommer,Manuel Sorge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the complexity of optimizing decision trees through local-search operations like adjusting thresholds or exchanging features, showing these problems are NP-complete but become tractable when both the number of features and domain size are small.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational complexity of common heuristic operations used in decision tree learning algorithms, specifically when minimizing classification errors through a fixed number of local-search operations.

Method: Parameterized-complexity analysis of decision tree optimization problems, focusing on threshold adjustment and feature exchange operations. The study examines how different parameters affect tractability.

Result: The problems are NP-complete in general but become fixed-parameter tractable when both the number of features (d) and domain size (D) are small, with an algorithm running in (D+1)^(2d) * |I|^O(1) time. A proof-of-concept implementation was developed and tested.

Conclusion: The combination of small feature count and small domain size makes decision tree optimization problems tractable, providing insights into when heuristic local-search operations can be efficiently applied in practice.

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical federated learning architecture for smart agriculture with seasonal subscription mechanism, enabling crop-specific model training while preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of heterogeneous farming environments and privacy-sensitive agricultural data in smart agricultural production systems, while enabling both local specialization for individual crop types and global generalization across diverse contexts.

Method: Three-layer hierarchical architecture with seasonal subscription: individual smart farms at client level, crop-specific aggregators at middle layer, and global model aggregator at top level. Farms join crop-specific clusters each season for collaborative training of specialized crop models.

Result: Local and crop-layer models closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly outperforming standard machine learning models. The system effectively integrates knowledge across multiple crops while preserving data privacy.

Conclusion: Hierarchical federated learning is advantageous for agricultural contexts, particularly for scenarios with heterogeneous farming environments and privacy-sensitive data, enabling both specialized crop modeling and global generalization.

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

### [120] [Doctor Rashomon and the UNIVERSE of Madness: Variable Importance with Unobserved Confounding and the Rashomon Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12734)
*Jon Donnelly,Srikar Katta,Emanuele Borgonovo,Cynthia Rudin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UNIVERSE introduces a method to bound variable importance (VI) estimates by considering Rashomon sets (near-optimal models) to address issues of omitted variables and model dependence in VI analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VI methods are limited because feature importance depends on which other variables are included, essential variables are often missing from observational data, and different equally-good models can yield different VI estimates (Rashomon Effect).

Method: UNIVERSE adapts Rashomon sets - collections of near-optimal models - to produce bounds on true variable importance even when features are missing from the dataset.

Result: The approach provides theoretical guarantees of robustness, demonstrates strong performance on semi-synthetic simulations, and shows practical utility in credit risk applications.

Conclusion: UNIVERSE offers a principled framework for more reliable variable importance estimation that accounts for model uncertainty and missing variables through Rashomon set analysis.

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

### [121] [KoALA: KL-L0 Adversarial Detector via Label Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12752)
*Siqi Li,Yasser Shoukry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KoALA is a semantics-free adversarial detector that uses disagreement between KL divergence and L0-based similarity metrics to detect adversarial attacks without requiring architectural changes or adversarial retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose serious risks to security- and safety-critical applications, necessitating effective detection methods.

Method: KoALA detects adversarial attacks when class predictions from two complementary similarity metrics (KL divergence for dense perturbations and L0-based similarity for sparse perturbations) disagree, with only simple fine-tuning required on clean images.

Result: KoALA achieves precision of 0.94 and recall of 0.81 on ResNet/CIFAR-10, and precision of 0.66 and recall of 0.85 on CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet, effectively detecting adversarial examples when theoretical conditions are met.

Conclusion: KoALA provides a lightweight, plug-and-play solution for adversarial detection that works across different models and data modalities without requiring architectural modifications or extensive retraining.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.
