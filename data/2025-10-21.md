### [1] [Rank-based concordance for zero-inflated data: New representations, estimators, and sharp bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16504)
*Jasper Arends,Guanjie Lyu,Mhamed Mesfioui,Elisa Perrone,Julien Trufin*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces new formulations of Gini's gamma and Spearman's footrule specifically designed for zero-inflated continuous data, correcting previous expressions for Spearman's rho and establishing theoretical bounds for these measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional concordance measures fail with tied data, which is problematic for zero-inflated data common in insurance, weather forecasting, and biomedical applications where there's a discrete mass at zero combined with continuous components.

Method: Developed new formulations of rank-based concordance measures (Gini's gamma and Spearman's footrule) tailored to zero-inflated continuous distributions, established theoretical bounds, and validated through simulations and real-world applications.

Result: Established best-possible upper and lower bounds for concordance measures in zero-inflated settings, making estimators practical and interpretable. Demonstrated significant impact of zero inflation on dependence estimation through simulations and real applications.

Conclusion: Appropriately adjusted zero-inflated concordance measures provide substantial benefits over traditional approaches, with the new formulations offering improved accuracy and interpretability for data containing ties and zero inflation.

Abstract: Quantifying concordance between two random variables is crucial in
applications. Traditional estimation techniques for commonly used concordance
measures, such as Gini's gamma or Spearman's rho, often fail when data contain
ties. This is particularly problematic for zero-inflated data, characterized by
a combination of discrete mass in zero and a continuous component, which
frequently appear in insurance, weather forecasting, and biomedical
applications. This study provides a new formulation of Gini's gamma and
Spearman's footrule, two rank-based concordance measures that incorporate
absolute rank differences, tailored to zero-inflated continuous distributions.
Along the way, we correct an expression of Spearman's rho for zero-inflated
data previously presented in the literature. The best-possible upper and lower
bounds for these measures in zero-inflated continuous settings are established,
making the estimators useful and interpretable in practice. We pair our
theoretical results with simulations and two real-life applications in
insurance and weather forecasting, respectively. Our results illustrate the
impact of zero inflation on dependence estimation, emphasizing the benefits of
appropriately adjusted zero-inflated measures.

### [2] [Correlation of divergency: c-delta. Being different in a similar way or not](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16717)
*Johan F. Hoorn*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces c-delta, a new statistical measure that quantifies similarity in internal divergence patterns between two groups, unlike traditional correlation coefficients that assess paired value associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a statistical measure that evaluates whether the way values differ within one group is mirrored in another group, addressing limitations of conventional correlation coefficients that only assess paired value associations.

Method: Calculate for each value its divergence from all other values in its group, then compare these divergence patterns across two groups. The coefficient is normalized by the average root mean square divergence within each group to ensure scale invariance.

Result: C-delta provides a new perspective for analyzing internal variability and divergence, with applications in quantum physics, genetics, ecology, psychometrics, manufacturing, machine learning, and social network analysis.

Conclusion: C-delta offers a valuable alternative approach for benchmarking, clustering validation, and assessing similarity of variability structures, though it's not bounded between -1 and 1 and may be sensitive to outliers like PMCC.

Abstract: This paper introduces the correlation-of-divergency coefficient, c-delta, a
custom statistical measure designed to quantify the similarity of internal
divergence patterns between two groups of values. Unlike conventional
correlation coefficients such as Pearson or Spearman, which assess the
association between paired values, c-delta evaluates whether the way values
differ within one group is mirrored in another. The method involves
calculating, for each value, its divergence from all other values in its group,
and then comparing these patterns across the two groups (e.g., human vs machine
intelligence). The coefficient is normalised by the average root mean square
divergence within each group, ensuring scale invariance. Potential applications
of c-delta span quantum physics, where it can compare the spread of measurement
outcomes between quantum systems, as well as fields such as genetics, ecology,
psychometrics, manufacturing, machine learning, and social network analysis.
The measure is particularly useful for benchmarking, clustering validation, and
assessing the similarity of variability structures. While c-delta is not
bounded between -1 and 1 and may be sensitive to outliers (but so is PMCC), it
offers a new perspective for analysing internal variability and divergence. The
article discusses the mathematical formulation, potential adaptations for
complex data, and the interpretative considerations relevant to this
alternative approach.

### [3] [Discovering Causal Relationships using Proxy Variables under Unmeasured Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17167)
*Yong Wu,Yanwei Fu,Shouyan Wang,Yizhou Wang,Xinwei Sun*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A new nonparametric method for testing causal relationships under unmeasured confounding using negative controls, applicable to both discrete and continuous settings with improved efficiency over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for causal inference with unmeasured confounding are limited to discrete settings or require strong assumptions, creating a need for more general and robust approaches.

Method: Developed a kernel-based testing procedure using a single negative control outcome (NCO) based on a new integral equation, with extensions using negative control exposure (NCE) when NCO alone is insufficient.

Result: The method achieves asymptotic level and power properties, demonstrates effectiveness through simulations and real-world data from Intensive Care Data and World Values Survey, and shows improved efficiency over moment-restriction methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a general framework for causal testing under unmeasured confounding that accommodates both discrete and continuous settings with minimal assumptions.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs in the observational
study is crucial but challenging, due to the presence of unmeasured
confounding. While previous methods employed the negative controls to adjust
for the confounding bias, they were either restricted to the discrete setting
(i.e., all variables are discrete) or relied on strong assumptions for
identification. To address these problems, we develop a general nonparametric
approach that accommodates both discrete and continuous settings for testing
causal hypothesis under unmeasured confounders. By using only a single negative
control outcome (NCO), we establish a new identification result based on a
newly proposed integral equation that links the outcome and NCO, requiring only
the completeness and mild regularity conditions. We then propose a kernel-based
testing procedure that is more efficient than existing moment-restriction
methods. We derive the asymptotic level and power properties for our tests.
Furthermore, we examine cases where our procedure using only NCO fails to
achieve identification, and introduce a new procedure that incorporates a
negative control exposure (NCE) to restore identifiability. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations and real-world data
from the Intensive Care Data and World Values Survey.

### [4] [Extending Prediction-Powered Inference through Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16166)
*Daniel Csillag,Pedro Dall'Antonia,Claudio Jos√© Struchiner,Guilherme Tegoni Goedert*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper connects prediction-powered inference with conformal prediction to achieve valid statistical inference with additional guarantees like privacy and robustness, addressing limitations of standard prediction-powered methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard prediction-powered inference lacks guarantees for privacy, robustness, and validity under continuous distribution shifts, requiring case-by-case solutions for different applications.

Method: The method performs imputation through calibrated conformal set-predictors, enabling validity while naturally achieving additional guarantees. It's instantiated for means, Z- and M-estimation, e-values, and e-value-based procedures.

Result: The approach provides the first general prediction-powered procedure that operates off-line for e-values, and demonstrates advantages on private and time-series data where standard methods are nontrivial.

Conclusion: Connecting prediction-powered inference with conformal prediction creates a unified framework that naturally handles privacy, robustness, and distribution shift concerns while maintaining valid statistical inference.

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference is a recent methodology for the safe use of
black-box ML models to impute missing data, strengthening inference of
statistical parameters. However, many applications require strong properties
besides valid inference, such as privacy, robustness or validity under
continuous distribution shifts; deriving prediction-powered methods with such
guarantees is generally an arduous process, and has to be done case by case. In
this paper, we resolve this issue by connecting prediction-powered inference
with conformal prediction: by performing imputation through a calibrated
conformal set-predictor, we attain validity while achieving additional
guarantees in a natural manner. We instantiate our procedure for the inference
of means, Z- and M-estimation, as well as e-values and e-value-based
procedures. Furthermore, in the case of e-values, ours is the first general
prediction-powered procedure that operates off-line. We demonstrate these
advantages by applying our method on private and time-series data. Both tasks
are nontrivial within the standard prediction-powered framework but become
natural under our method.

proposals is demonstrated by means of three real data sets.

### [6] [Heterogeneity-Aware Federated Causal Inference Leveraging Effect-Measure Transportability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16317)
*Siqi Cao,Shu Yang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper proposes federated learning methods for causal estimands that improve estimation efficiency by leveraging multiple data sources while preserving privacy. It introduces semiparametric efficient estimators under different transportability assumptions and a Post-Federated Weighting Selection framework to handle incompatible sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing literature focusing on average treatment effects using single data sources, and to develop more efficient causal estimation methods that can leverage multiple study sites while maintaining privacy protection.

Method: The authors derive semiparametrically efficient estimators under two transportability assumptions and propose a Post-Federated Weighting Selection (PFWS) framework - a two-step procedure that adaptively identifies compatible sites and achieves semiparametric efficiency bounds asymptotically. The method incorporates flexible machine learning algorithms for nuisance functions.

Result: Through extensive simulations and real-data analysis, the PFWS framework demonstrates superior variance efficiency compared to target-only analyses across diverse transportability scenarios, while maintaining parametric convergence rates and nominal coverage.

Conclusion: The proposed federated learning approach for causal estimands effectively improves estimation efficiency by leveraging multiple data sources, with the PFWS framework providing robust performance even when some source sites violate transportability assumptions, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Federated learning of causal estimands offers a powerful strategy to improve
estimation efficiency by leveraging data from multiple study sites while
preserving privacy. Existing literature has primarily focused on the average
treatment effect using single data source, whereas our work addresses a broader
class of causal measures across multiple sources. We derive and compare
semiparametrically efficient estimators under two transportability assumptions,
which impose different restrictions on the data likelihood and illustrate the
efficiency-robustness tradeoff. This estimator also permits the incorporation
of flexible machine learning algorithms for nuisance functions while
maintaining parametric convergence rates and nominal coverage. To further
handle scenarios where some source sites violate transportability, we propose a
Post-Federated Weighting Selection (PFWS) framework, which is a two-step
procedure that adaptively identifies compatible sites and achieves the
semiparametric efficiency bound asymptotically. This framework mitigates the
efficiency loss of weighting methods and the instability and computational
burden of direct site selection in finite samples. Through extensive
simulations and real-data analysis, we demonstrate that our PFWS framework
achieves superior variance efficiency compared with the target-only analyses
across diverse transportability scenarios.

### [7] [Common-Individual Embedding for Dynamic Networks with Temporal Group Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16337)
*Hairi Bai,Xinyan Fan,Kuangnan Fang,Yan Zhang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: STANE is a dynamic network embedding framework that captures both stable global structures and localized temporal variations, with Sparse STANE adding sparse perturbations for better adaptability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either overlook cross-time similarities or enforce overly smooth evolution, failing to balance persistence and change in dynamic networks.

Method: Integrates temporal clustering with sparse deviation modeling, modeling time-specific changes as sparse perturbations to capture both stable structures and transient variations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic and real-world political conflict networks, improving temporal clustering accuracy and structural recovery with non-asymptotic error guarantees.

Conclusion: STANE demonstrates the power of structured dynamic embeddings for revealing interpretable patterns in network evolution, particularly valuable in applications like international relations modeling where both persistent and transient connections matter.

Abstract: We propose STANE (Shared and Time-specific Adaptive Network Embedding), a new
joint embedding framework for dynamic networks that captures both stable global
structures and localized temporal variations. To further improve the model's
adaptability to transient changes, we introduce Sparse STANE, which models
time-specific changes as sparse perturbations, thereby improving
interpretability. Unlike existing methods that either overlook cross-time
similarities or enforce overly smooth evolution, Sparse STANE integrates
temporal clustering with sparse deviation modeling to strike a flexible balance
between persistence and change. We also provide non-asymptotic error guarantees
of embeddings and show that our estimator can reliably identify changed node
pairs when deviations are sparse. On synthetic and real-world political
conflict networks, STANE and its extensions improve temporal clustering
accuracy and structural recovery, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
These results highlight the potential of STANE in applications such as
international relations modeling, where both persistent and transient
connections matter. Our findings underscore the power of structured dynamic
embeddings for revealing interpretable patterns in network evolution.

### [8] [Spatial Scalar-on-Function Quantile Regression Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16429)
*Muge Mutis,Ufuk Beyaztas,Filiz Karaman,Han Lin Shang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a spatial scalar-on-function quantile regression model that incorporates spatial dependence and handles heterogeneous conditional distributions, with robust estimation procedures for spatial endogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend classical scalar-on-function models to account for spatial dependence and characterize entire conditional distributions rather than just means, addressing limitations in handling spatial autocorrelation and outlier contamination.

Method: Developed a spatial scalar-on-function quantile regression model with spatially lagged response, using instrumental variable strategies to address endogeneity from spatial lag terms, with two robust estimation procedures.

Result: The proposed estimators achieve ‚àön-consistency and asymptotic normality, outperform existing methods in simulations with strong spatial dependence and outliers, and show superior predictive accuracy in environmental data application.

Conclusion: The method provides improved predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability across quantile levels, with implementation available in the ssofqrm R package.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel spatial scalar-on-function quantile regression
model that extends classical scalar-on-function models to account for spatial
dependence and heterogeneous conditional distributions. The proposed model
incorporates spatial autocorrelation through a spatially lagged response and
characterizes the entire conditional distribution of a scalar outcome given a
functional predictor. To address the endogeneity induced by the spatial lag
term, we develop two robust estimation procedures based on instrumental
variable strategies. $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality of the
proposed estimators are established under mild regularity conditions. We
demonstrate through extensive Monte Carlo simulations that the proposed
estimators outperform existing mean-based and robust alternatives, particularly
in settings with strong spatial dependence and outlier contamination. We apply
our method to high-resolution environmental data from the Lombardy region in
Italy, using daily ozone trajectories to predict daily mean particulate matter
with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers concentrations. The empirical
results confirm the superiority of our approach in predictive accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability across various quantile levels. Our method has
been implemented in the \texttt{ssofqrm} R package.

### [9] [Sensitivity Analysis to Unobserved Confounders: A Comparative Review to Estimate Confounding Strength in Sensitivity Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16560)
*Jean-Baptiste Baitairian,Bernard Sebastien,Rana Jreich,Sandrine Katsahian,Agathe Guilloux*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper reviews sensitivity analysis methods for Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) estimators, focusing on Marginal Sensitivity Models that relax the ignorability assumption in causal inference when unobserved confounding exists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ignorability assumption in causal inference is often unrealistic in observational studies due to unobserved confounding variables. While sensitivity models exist to address this limitation, determining appropriate sensitivity parameters and interpreting results remain challenging obstacles to practical adoption.

Method: The paper reviews different strategies for sensitivity analysis using Marginal Sensitivity Models for IPW estimators, including methods to estimate or lower bound the confounding strength parameter and approaches for selecting suitable methods while avoiding interpretation pitfalls.

Result: The review synthesizes existing literature on deriving sharp and robust bounds for treatment effects under sensitivity models, covering both binary and continuous treatments, and provides guidance on parameter specification and result interpretation.

Conclusion: The paper aims to facilitate practical adoption of sensitivity analysis methods by addressing key challenges in parameter determination and interpretation, providing a comprehensive overview of strategies to handle unobserved confounding in causal inference.

Abstract: Causal inference is only valid when its underlying assumptions are satisfied,
one of the most central being the ignorability assumption (also known as
unconfoundedness or exogeneity). In practice, however, this assumption is often
unrealistic in observational studies, as some confounding variables may remain
unobserved. To address this limitation, sensitivity models for Inverse
Probability Weighting (IPW) estimators, known as Marginal Sensitivity Models,
have been introduced, allowing for a controlled relaxation of ignorability.
Over the past decades, a substantial body of literature has emerged around
these models, aiming to derive sharp and robust bounds for both binary and
continuous treatment effects. A key element of these approaches is the
specification of a sensitivity parameter, sometimes referred to as the
"confounding strength", which quantifies the extent of deviation from
ignorability. Yet, determining an appropriate value for this parameter is
challenging, and the final interpretation of sensitivity analyses can be
unclear. We believe these difficulties represent major obstacles to the
adoption of such methods in practice. In this review, after introducing
sensitivity analyses for IPW estimators, we focus on different strategies to
estimate or lower bound the confounding strength, select the most suitable
approach, and avoid common pitfalls in the interpretation of results.

### [10] [Identification and estimation of causal mechanisms in cluster-randomized trials with post-treatment confounding using Bayesian nonparametrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16673)
*Yuki Ohnishi,Michael J. Daniels,Lei Yang,Fan Li*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A Bayesian nonparametric framework for causal mediation analysis in cluster-randomized trials that handles interference and post-treatment confounding using a multivariate Gaussian copula and nested Dirichlet process priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal mediation analysis in CRTs is complicated by interference, post-treatment confounding, and hierarchical covariate adjustment, requiring methods that can simultaneously address these challenges.

Method: Bayesian nonparametric framework with multivariate Gaussian copula for identification and nested common atoms enriched Dirichlet process (CA-EDP) prior for estimation, integrating CAM for cross-cluster information sharing and EDP for robust covariate adjustment.

Result: The method provides formal theoretical support with distributional properties and convergence guarantees, and demonstrates good performance in simulations and reanalysis of a completed CRT.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in CRT mediation analysis by accommodating interference and post-treatment confounding while providing robust estimation and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Causal mediation analysis in cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) is essential
for explaining how cluster-level interventions affect individual outcomes, yet
it is complicated by interference, post-treatment confounding, and hierarchical
covariate adjustment. We develop a Bayesian nonparametric framework that
simultaneously accommodates interference and a post-treatment confounder that
precedes the mediator. Identification is achieved through a multivariate
Gaussian copula that replaces cross-world independence with a single dependence
parameter, yielding a built-in sensitivity analysis to residual post-treatment
confounding. For estimation, we introduce a nested common atoms enriched
Dirichlet process (CA-EDP) prior that integrates the Common Atoms Model (CAM)
to share information across clusters while capturing between- and
within-cluster heterogeneity, and an Enriched Dirichlet Process (EDP) structure
delivering robust covariate adjustment without impacting the outcome model. We
provide formal theoretical support for our prior by deriving the model's key
distributional properties, including its partially exchangeable partition
structure, and by establishing convergence guarantees for the practical
truncation-based posterior inference strategy. We demonstrate the performance
of the proposed methods in simulations and provide further illustration through
a reanalysis of a completed CRT.

### [11] [Causal inference for calibrated scaling interventions on time-to-event processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16798)
*Helene Charlotte Wiese Rytgaard,Mark van der Laan*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces stochastic interventions in continuous-time event-history settings using multiplicative intensity scalings, creating causal estimands indexed by parameter Œ±. It proposes calibrated interventions to achieve specific goals and presents estimation methods using targeted maximum likelihood estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a flexible alternative to deterministic interventions in survival and longitudinal settings, enabling practical yet statistically principled intervention analysis for time-to-event treatments or mediators.

Method: Uses multiplicative scalings of observed intensity for intermediate event processes, defines calibrated interventions with parameter Œ± chosen to achieve specific goals, and employs targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with efficient influence curves.

Result: Develops a framework for causal estimands indexed by Œ± that preserve temporal and covariate structure, with double robustness properties for various target parameters under nonparametric models.

Conclusion: The proposed stochastic intervention framework offers a flexible and pragmatic approach for causal analysis in event-history settings, serving as an analogue to indirect/direct effect decompositions and applicable to various causal questions involving time-to-event treatments.

Abstract: This work studies stochastic interventions in continuous-time event-history
settings formulated as multiplicative scalings of the observed intensity
governing an intermediate event process. This gives rise to a family of causal
estimands indexed by a scalar parameter {\alpha}, which changes the event rate
while preserving the temporal and covariate structure of the data-generating
process. We introduce calibrated interventions, where \(\alpha\) is chosen to
achieve a pre-specified goal, such as a desired level of cumulative risk of the
intermediate event, and define corresponding composite target parameters
capturing the resulting effects on the outcome process. Our proposal enables
practical yet statistically principled intervention analysis in survival and
longitudinal settings, which offers a flexible alternative to deterministic or
static interventions that are often ill-defined. The framework applies broadly
to causal questions involving time-to-event treatments or mediators, and offers
a pragmatic analogue to indirect/direct effect decompositions. We present the
efficient influence curves for various versions of target parameters under a
nonparametric statistical model, discuss their double robustness properties,
and propose an estimation procedure based on targeted maximum likelihood
estimation (TMLE). The proposed estimands are illustrated through examples of
event-history scenarios addressing distinct causal questions.

### [12] [Causal Variance Decompositions for Measuring Health Inequalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16975)
*Lin Yu,Zhihui Liu,Kathy Han,Olli Saarela*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces an eight-way causal variance decomposition method for analyzing healthcare disparities in hospital profiling, focusing on polytomous exposures and comparing hospital performance to system-wide averages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing causal inference methods that typically focus on pairwise comparisons, particularly in hospital profiling where understanding sources of healthcare disparities between sociodemographic groups is crucial for identifying access/selection issues versus actual effect modification.

Method: Developed a new eight-way causal variance decomposition framework that attributes observed variation in care delivery to: main effects of hospital and group membership, modification of hospital effect by group membership, hospital access/selection, case-mix covariates effects, and residual variance. Formulated both parametric and nonparametric model-based estimators.

Result: The method provides causal interpretation of variance components and was validated through simulation studies. Applied to cancer care delivery data from the SEER database to demonstrate practical implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed eight-way decomposition offers a comprehensive framework for quantifying sources of healthcare disparities in hospital profiling, enabling better understanding of whether observed inequalities stem from access/selection issues or actual effect modification, with applications demonstrated in cancer care delivery analysis.

Abstract: Recent causal inference literature has introduced causal effect
decompositions to quantify sources of observed inequalities or disparities in
outcomes but usually limiting this to pairwise comparisons. In the context of
hospital profiling, comparison of hospital performance may reveal inequalities
in healthcare delivery between sociodemographic groups, which may be explained
by access/selection or actual effect modification. We consider the case of
polytomous exposures in hospital profiling where the comparison is often to the
system wide average performance, and decompose the observed variance in care
delivery as the quantity of interest. For this, we formulate a new eight-way
causal variance decomposition where we attribute the observed variation to
components describing the main effects of hospital and group membership,
modification of the hospital effect by group membership, hospital
access/selection, effect of case-mix covariates and residual variance. We
discuss the causal interpretation of the components, formulate parametric and
nonparametric model based estimators and study the properties of these
estimators through simulation. Finally, we illustrate our method by an example
of cancer care delivery using data from the SEER database.

### [13] [Functional principal component analysis for functional data with detection limits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16992)
*Haiyan Liu,Jeanine Houwing-Duistermaat*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper extends functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to handle data with detection limits, addressing missing not at random (MNAR) issues in longitudinal biomarker studies where observations fall below or above detection thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard FPCA methods ignore MNAR mechanisms by imputing detection limit values, leading to biased estimates of principal components and scores in longitudinal biomarker studies with detection limits.

Method: Building on Liu and Houwing-Duistermaat's estimators for mean and covariance functions under detection limits, the authors extend FPCA to accommodate functional data affected by such limits and derive asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators.

Result: Simulations show the proposed method yields more accurate estimates of functional principal components and scores compared to standard methods that ignore MNAR mechanisms.

Conclusion: The extended FPCA approach enhances the reliability of functional data analysis in the presence of detection limits by providing more accurate estimation of principal components and scores.

Abstract: When measurements fall below or above a detection threshold, the resulting
data are missing not at random (MNAR), posing challenges for statistical
analysis. For example, in longitudinal biomarker studies, observations may be
subject to detection limits. Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is
commonly used method for dimension reduction of dense and sparse data measured
along a continuum, but standard approaches typically ignore MNAR mechanisms by
imputing detection limit values, leading to biased estimates of principal
components and scores.
  Building on recent work by Liu and Houwing-Duistermaat (2022, 2023), who
proposed estimators for the mean and covariance functions under detection
limits, we extend FPCA to accommodate functional data affected by such limits.
We derive the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators and assess
their performance through simulations, comparing them to standard methods.
Finally, we illustrate our approach using longitudinal biomarker data subject
to detection limits.
  Our method yields more accurate estimates of functional principal components
and scores, enhancing the reliability of functional data analysis in the
presence of detection limits.

*Fatemeh Mahmoudi,Chenxi Li,Kaida Cai,Xuewen Lu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A penalized variable selection method for interval-censored competing risks data using semiparametric transformation models with broken adaptive ridge penalty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Competing risks data with multiple mutually exclusive events are common in medical research but require specialized methods for variable selection in interval-censored settings.

Method: Developed a penalized variable selection procedure using broken adaptive ridge (BAR) penalty within semiparametric transformation regression models for interval-censored competing risks data.

Result: The method establishes oracle properties, performs well in simulations, and successfully applies to a real HIV cohort dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed BAR-based approach effectively handles variable selection for competing risks data in interval-censored settings, with theoretical guarantees and practical applicability.

Abstract: Competing risks data refer to situations where the occurrence of one event
pre- cludes the possibility of other events happening, resulting in multiple
mutually exclusive events. This data type is commonly encountered in medical
research and clinical trials, exploring the interplay between different events
and informing decision-making in fields such as healthcare and epidemiology. We
develop a penal- ized variable selection procedure to handle such complex data
in an interval-censored setting. We consider a broad class of semiparametric
transformation regression mod- els, including popular models such as
proportional and non-proportional hazards models. To promote sparsity and
select variables specific to each event, we employ the broken adaptive ridge
(BAR) penalty. This approach allows us to simultane- ously select important
risk factors and estimate their effects for each event under investigation. We
establish the oracle property of the BAR procedure and evaluate its performance
through simulation studies. The proposed method is applied to a real-life HIV
cohort dataset, further validating its applicability in practice.

### [15] [On Misspecified Error Distributions in Bayesian Functional Clustering: Consequences and Remedies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17215)
*Fumiya Iwashige,Tomoya Wakayama,Shonosuke Sugasawa,Shintaro Hashimoto*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper shows that overestimation of clusters in nonparametric Bayesian functional clustering stems from ignoring error correlation, and proposes using Gaussian processes to model this dependence, which significantly improves clustering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonparametric Bayesian approaches for functional data clustering tend to overestimate the number of clusters due to misspecification of error structure, where errors are incorrectly assumed to be independent across observed points.

Method: The authors propose incorporating underlying correlation structures via Gaussian processes and present a scalable approximation with principled hyperparameter selection to properly model error dependence in functional data clustering.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that even simple Dirichlet process-based clustering performs well when error dependence is properly modeled, overcoming the overestimation problem.

Conclusion: Properly modeling error correlation structure is crucial for accurate clustering in functional data, and Gaussian process-based approaches provide an effective solution to the overestimation problem in nonparametric Bayesian clustering.

Abstract: Nonparametric Bayesian approaches provide a flexible framework for clustering
without pre-specifying the number of groups, yet they are well known to
overestimate the number of clusters, especially for functional data. We show
that a fundamental cause of this phenomenon lies in misspecification of the
error structure: errors are conventionally assumed to be independent across
observed points in Bayesian functional models. Through high-dimensional
clustering theory, we demonstrate that ignoring the underlying correlation
leads to excess clusters regardless of the flexibility of prior distributions.
Guided by this theory, we propose incorporating the underlying correlation
structures via Gaussian processes and also present its scalable approximation
with principled hyperparameter selection. Numerical experiments illustrate that
even simple clustering based on Dirichlet processes performs well once error
dependence is properly modeled.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Œ±-qTOST, a finite-sample adjustment to the quantile equivalence testing method (qTOST) that addresses over-conservatism in heterogeneous Gaussian samples. The method achieves higher power while maintaining nominal test size, especially for extreme quantiles under heteroskedasticity and small, unbalanced samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional mean-based methods are inadequate for testing equivalence of multiple quantiles between populations, particularly in bridging studies for drug development where extreme quantiles directly inform efficacy and safety assessments. Existing qTOST method tends to be overly conservative when analyzing heterogeneous Gaussian samples.

Method: The authors propose Œ±-qTOST, a finite-sample adjustment to the qTOST method. They extend the quantile equivalence framework to simultaneously assess equivalence across multiple quantiles. The approach is validated through theoretical guarantees and extensive simulation studies.

Result: Œ±-qTOST achieves uniformly higher power compared to qTOST while maintaining test size at the nominal level. Substantial improvements are demonstrated, especially when testing extreme quantiles under heteroskedasticity and with small, unbalanced sample sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed Œ±-qTOST method offers significant advantages over existing approaches for quantile equivalence testing, making it particularly valuable for bridging studies in clinical trials and other scientific applications where multiple quantile comparisons are needed under challenging conditions like heteroskedasticity and unbalanced sample sizes.

Abstract: Testing the equivalence of multiple quantiles between two populations is
important in many scientific applications, such as clinical trials, where
conventional mean-based methods may be inadequate. This is particularly
relevant in bridging studies that compare drug responses across different
experimental conditions or patient populations. These studies often aim to
assess whether a proposed dose for a target population achieves pharmacokinetic
levels comparable to those of a reference population where efficacy and safety
have been established. The focus is on extreme quantiles which directly inform
both efficacy and safety assessments. When analyzing heterogeneous Gaussian
samples, where a single quantile of interest is estimated, the existing Two
One-Sided Tests method for quantile equivalence testing (qTOST) tends to be
overly conservative. To mitigate this behavior, we introduce $\alpha$-qTOST, a
finite-sample adjustment that achieves uniformly higher power compared to qTOST
while maintaining the test size at the nominal level. Moreover, we extend the
quantile equivalence framework to simultaneously assess equivalence across
multiple quantiles. Through theoretical guarantees and an extensive simulation
study, we demonstrate that $\alpha$-qTOST offers substantial improvements,
especially when testing extreme quantiles under heteroskedasticity and with
small, unbalanced sample sizes. We illustrate these advantages through two case
studies, one in HIV drug development, where a bridging clinical trial examines
exposure distributions between male and female populations with unbalanced
sample sizes, and another in assessing the reproducibility of an identical
experimental protocol performed by different operators for generating
biodistribution profiles of topically administered and locally acting products.

### [17] [Defining Utility as a Measure of Preference Under Uncertainty in Phase I-II Oncology Dose Finding Trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17550)
*Andrew Hall,Duncan Wilson,Stuart Barber,Sarah R Brown*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A Bayesian decision-theoretic framework called R2DT is proposed for dose finding trials in oncology, using a utility function based on efficacy and toxicity that incorporates reference-dependent risk attitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better capture real clinical judgements in dose finding by allowing varying attitudes to risk for gains vs losses relative to reference points, improving on traditional approaches.

Method: Bayesian decision-theoretic approach with a new utility function grounded in von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory, incorporating reference points for defining gains and losses in efficacy and toxicity.

Result: Simulation studies show R2DT performs well with good operating characteristics, particularly better at detecting optimal doses when candidate doses are near efficacy and toxicity thresholds.

Conclusion: The flexible utility function better captures clinician beliefs and leads to trials with good operating characteristics, demonstrating proof-of-concept for this reference-dependent framework.

Abstract: The main objective of dose finding trials is to find an optimal dose amongst
a candidate set for further research. The trial design in oncology proceeds in
stages with a decision as to how to treat the next group of patients made at
every stage until a final sample size is reached or the trial stopped early.
  This work applies a Bayesian decision-theoretic approach to the problem,
proposing a new utility function based on both efficacy and toxicity and
grounded in von Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM) utility theory. Our proposed
framework seeks to better capture real clinical judgements by allowing
attitudes to risk to vary when the judgements are of gains or losses, which are
defined with respect to an intermediate outcome known as a reference point. We
call this method Reference Dependent Decision Theoretic dose finding (R2DT).
  A simulation study demonstrates that the framework can perform well and
produce good operating characteristics. The simulation results demonstrate that
R2DT is better at detecting the optimal dose in scenarios where candidate doses
are around minimum acceptable efficacy and maximum acceptable toxicity
thresholds.
  The proposed framework shows that a flexible utility function, which better
captures clinician beliefs, can lead to trials with good operating
characteristics, including a high probability of finding the optimal dose. Our
work demonstrates proof-of-concept for this framework, which should be
evaluated in a broader range of settings.

*Priyanjali Bukke,Martin Slawski*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: Extension of regression framework for linked data that relaxes the strong non-informative linkage assumption, allowing linkage to depend on covariates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linkage errors in multi-source data analysis can invalidate post-linkage inference, especially when only linked data is available with limited linkage process information.

Method: Two-component mixture model extension that relaxes the assumption that linkage doesn't depend on analysis covariates, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Result: Effectiveness demonstrated through simulations and case study showing improved performance when linkage depends on covariates.

Conclusion: The extended framework provides more realistic and practical approach for regression analysis with linked data by accounting for covariate-dependent linkage processes.

Abstract: Data analysis of files that are a result of linking records from multiple
sources are often affected by linkage errors. Records may be linked
incorrectly, or their links may be missed. In consequence, it is essential that
such errors are taken into account to ensure valid post-linkage inference.
Here, we propose an extension to a general framework for regression with linked
covariates and responses based on a two-component mixture model, which was
developed in prior work. This framework addresses the challenging case of
secondary analysis in which only the linked data is available and information
about the record linkage process is limited. The extension considered herein
relaxes the assumption of strongly non-informative linkage in the framework
according to which linkage does not depend on the covariates used in the
analysis, which may be limiting in practice. The effectiveness of the proposed
extension is investigated by simulations and a case study.

TL;DR: Lean Finder is a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that understands mathematician intents through fine-tuned embeddings and user feedback alignment, achieving 30%+ improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in formal theorem proving is hindered by difficulty locating relevant theorems and Lean 4's steep learning curve, with existing search engines overlooking real-world user query mismatches.

Method: Analyze and cluster semantics of public Lean discussions, fine-tune text embeddings on synthesized queries emulating user intents, and align with mathematician preferences using diverse feedback signals.

Result: Achieves over 30% relative improvement compared to previous search engines and GPT-4o on real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states.

Conclusion: Lean Finder provides user-centered semantic search tailored to mathematicians' needs and bridges retrieval with formal reasoning, being compatible with LLM-based theorem provers.

Abstract: We present Lean Finder, a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that
understands and aligns with the intents of mathematicians. Progress in formal
theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant
theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making
advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though
helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of
the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world
user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored
to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering
the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on
synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder
with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it
with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on
real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that
our Lean Finder achieves over $30\%$ relative improvement compared to previous
search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with
LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean

*Tianyu Bell Pan,Mengdi Zhu,Alexa Jordyn Cole,Ronald Wilson,Damon L. Woodard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LS-OGD is an adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning that dynamically adjusts learning rates and fusion weights to handle concept drift, ensuring bounded prediction errors and system resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning systems face performance degradation in non-stationary environments due to concept drift, particularly modality-specific drifts and lack of continuous adaptation mechanisms.

Method: LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the model's learning rate and fusion weights between different data modalities based on detected drift and evolving prediction errors.

Result: The framework ensures uniformly ultimately bounded prediction error under bounded drift conditions, with convergence to zero if drift ceases. It effectively isolates and mitigates modality-specific drift impact.

Conclusion: LS-OGD provides theoretical guarantees for developing reliable and continuously adapting multimodal learning systems with fault tolerance and resilience against concept drift.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due
to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance.
Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable
adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel
adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of
concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the
model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities
in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that
under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is
uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively
isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby
ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees
establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously
adapting multimodal learning systems.

*Guangya Wan,Zixin Stephen Xu,Sasa Zorc,Manel Baucells,Mengxuan Hu,Hao Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BEACON is an adaptive sampling framework that uses Bayesian learning to determine when to stop generating multiple LLM responses, reducing sampling by up to 80% while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling multiple responses improves LLM output quality but increases computational costs. The key challenge is determining the optimal stopping point to balance accuracy gains against efficiency.

Method: BEACON uses Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning to sequentially generate responses, update posterior belief over reward distributions in real time without training, and stop when marginal utility no longer justifies computational cost.

Result: BEACON reduces average sampling by up to 80% while maintaining response quality. It also demonstrates utility for cost-efficient preference data generation.

Conclusion: BEACON provides a principled adaptive sampling framework with theoretical optimality guarantees and practical tractability, offering actionable insights for efficient LLM sampling strategies.

Abstract: Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality,
but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is
deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against
efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive
Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework
grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially
generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward
distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to
stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates
once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the
expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical
tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up
to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's
utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical
extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PatMD improves harmful meme detection by identifying misjudgment risk patterns and proactively guiding MLLMs to avoid known pitfalls, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Internet memes are increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical devices like irony and metaphor, and existing detection approaches struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to frequent misjudgments.

Method: PatMD constructs a knowledge base where memes are deconstructed into misjudgment risk patterns, then retrieves relevant patterns for target memes to dynamically guide MLLM reasoning and avoid known misjudgment pitfalls.

Result: Experiments on 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with 8.30% improvement in F1-score and 7.71% improvement in accuracy.

Conclusion: PatMD demonstrates strong generalizability and improved detection capability for harmful memes by proactively mitigating misjudgment risks through pattern-based guidance.

Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are
increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical
devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including
MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to
frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that
improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating
these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial
content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk
patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We
first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a
misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either
overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign
content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant
patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning.
Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show
that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of
8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy,
demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of
harmful memes.

TL;DR: WaveNet-based deep learning model for automated EEG signal classification outperforms previous CNN and LSTM approaches, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing physiological, pathological, artifact, and noise categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EEG classification methods relying on expert visual review are becoming impractical due to increasing complexity and volume of EEG recordings, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: Used WaveNet architecture with dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, trained on 209,232 annotated EEG samples from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital with 70/20/10 train/validation/test split, including preprocessing with dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization.

Result: Achieved classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, with high precision in distinguishing noise and artifacts, though showed modest misclassification between physiological and pathological signals due to clinical overlap.

Conclusion: WaveNet architecture is well-suited for EEG classification due to its ability to capture both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies, providing an effective automated solution for EEG signal analysis.

Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to
automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological,
artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal
classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly
impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings.
Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St.
Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and
tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a
classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and
was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline.
Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision,
although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification
between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical
overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis,
is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and
residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range
temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline,
including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support
model generalization.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a keystroke dynamics-based pipeline for Parkinson's disease screening using deep learning models, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC in external validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parkinson's disease affects over 10 million people with prevalence expected to double by 2040, and early diagnosis is challenging due to late motor symptom emergence and limitations of traditional clinical assessments.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) preprocessing data from four datasets with temporal signal extraction and class imbalance handling, (2) pre-training eight deep-learning architectures with hyperparameter optimization, (3) fine-tuning on intermediate dataset and external validation on independent cohort.

Result: Hybrid convolutional-recurrent and transformer models achieved strong external validation with AUC-ROC >90% and F1-Score >70%. A temporal convolutional model attained 91.14% AUC-ROC in external validation, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Keystroke dynamics show promise as a reliable digital biomarker for Parkinson's disease, offering potential for early detection and continuous monitoring through non-invasive remote screening.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a growing global challenge, affecting over
10 million individuals, with prevalence expected to double by 2040. Early
diagnosis remains difficult due to the late emergence of motor symptoms and
limitations of traditional clinical assessments. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive and scalable
biomarker for remote PD screening and telemonitoring. Our methodology involves
three main stages: (i) preprocessing of data from four distinct datasets,
extracting four temporal signals and addressing class imbalance through the
comparison of three methods; (ii) pre-training eight state-of-the-art
deep-learning architectures on the two largest datasets, optimizing temporal
windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters; (iii) fine-tuning on an
intermediate-sized dataset and performing external validation on a fourth,
independent cohort. Our results demonstrate that hybrid convolutional-recurrent
and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation performance,
with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 90% and F1-Score over 70%. Notably, a temporal
convolutional model attains an AUC-ROC of 91.14% in external validation,
outperforming existing methods that rely solely on internal validation. These
findings underscore the potential of keystroke dynamics as a reliable digital
biomarker for PD, offering a promising avenue for early detection and
continuous monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As wildfires become more destructive and costly to control, there is a need for accurate real-time fire spread predictions. Data assimilation can improve forecasting by integrating observations with numerical models.

Method: The paper applies the Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF), a diffusion-model-based filtering algorithm, to wildfire data assimilation. EnSF leverages score-based generative diffusion models for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering problems.

Result: Numerical investigations demonstrate that EnSF provides superior accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency compared to other methods for wildfire data assimilation.

Conclusion: EnSF is established as a robust and practical method for wildfire data assimilation, with publicly available code for implementation.

Abstract: As wildfires become increasingly destructive and expensive to control,
effective management of active wildfires requires accurate, real-time fire
spread predictions. To enhance the forecasting accuracy of active fires, data
assimilation plays a vital role by integrating observations (such as
remote-sensing data) and fire predictions generated from numerical models. This
paper provides a comprehensive investigation on the application of a recently
proposed diffusion-model-based filtering algorithm -- the Ensemble Score Filter
(EnSF) -- to the data assimilation problem for real-time active wildfire spread
predictions. Leveraging a score-based generative diffusion model, EnSF has been
shown to have superior accuracy for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering
problems, making it an ideal candidate for the filtering problems of wildfire
spread models. Technical details are provided, and our numerical investigations
demonstrate that EnSF provides superior accuracy, stability, and computational
efficiency, establishing it as a robust and practical method for wildfire data
assimilation. Our code has been made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance sustainable energy and waste management by exploring underutilized biomass resources for hydrogen production and improving process efficiency through artificial intelligence integration.

Method: Conducted comprehensive analyses including proximate, ultimate, fiber, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC analyses on pure and blended biomass samples. Used isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) for kinetic modeling and trained an LSTM model with lignocellulosic data.

Result: Blend 3 (25% DS - 75% SCG) offered superior hydrogen yield potential but highest activation energy (313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1 (75% DS - 25% SCG) had best activation energy (161.75 kJ/mol). KAS method was most accurate for kinetic modeling. LSTM model achieved exceptional TGA curve prediction accuracy (R¬≤: 0.9996-0.9998).

Conclusion: The integration of artificial intelligence with thermochemical conversion processes enables accurate modeling and optimization of biomass pyrolysis for sustainable hydrogen production, demonstrating the potential of underutilized food-based biomass resources.

Abstract: This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management
strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass
through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main
objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such
as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen
production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while
evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends.
Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC
analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS
- 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential
but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1
exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic
modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS
as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the
pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial
intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA

TL;DR: LAMI is a joint graph-language modeling framework that detects illicit drug use in teenagers and young adults by learning latent connections in survey data and generating natural language explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat survey variables independently, overlooking latent and interconnected structures among demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use.

Method: LAMI represents individual survey responses as relational graphs, learns latent connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations.

Result: Experiments on YRBS and NSDUH datasets show LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in predictive accuracy and reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways.

Conclusion: LAMI effectively detects illicit drug use while providing interpretable insights into behavioral risk factors like family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress.

Abstract: Illicit drug use among teenagers and young adults (TYAs) remains a pressing
public health concern, with rising prevalence and long-term impacts on health
and well-being. To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze
large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich
demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use.
However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently,
overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this
limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal
Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for
detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs.
LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent
connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and
integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations
grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS
and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in
predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI
reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as
family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with
established risk factors for substance use.

*Zhuxuanzi Wang,Mingqiao Mo,Xi Xiao,Chen Liu,Chenrui Ma,Yunbei Zhang,Xiao Wang,Smita Krishnaswamy,Tianyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTR-LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization using curvature trust regions, achieving better performance and efficiency than existing PEFT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods often decouple capacity allocation from how updates evolve during training, leading to suboptimal efficiency and performance.

Method: CTR-LoRA uses curvature trust regions to allocate parameters based on marginal utility from second-order proxies and constrains updates using Fisher/Hessian-metric trust regions.

Result: Experiments on 7B-13B models show consistent improvements over strong PEFT baselines on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, with enhanced training stability, reduced memory requirements, and higher throughput.

Conclusion: CTR-LoRA provides a principled path toward more robust and deployable PEFT by positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the standard approach for
adapting large language models under limited compute and memory budgets.
Although previous methods improve efficiency through low-rank updates,
quantization, or heuristic budget reallocation, they often decouple the
allocation of capacity from the way updates evolve during training. In this
work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that
integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA
allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight
second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust
region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent
improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy,
CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves
higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and
efficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and
deployable PEFT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Long Exposure is an efficient system that accelerates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for large language models by addressing Shadowy Sparsity through three components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer, Sequence-oriented Predictor, and Dynamic-aware Operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational costs for adapting pre-trained LLMs to downstream tasks.

Method: The system addresses Shadowy Sparsity with three key components: 1) Shadowy-sparsity Exposer uses prolonged sensing to capture sparsity details, 2) Sequence-oriented Predictor handles large sequence inputs and evolving parameters, 3) Dynamic-aware Operator enables structured computational patterns and coalesced memory accesses.

Result: Extensive evaluations show Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 2.49√ó speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Long Exposure offers promising advancements in accelerating PEFT for LLMs by effectively addressing the unique challenges of Shadowy Sparsity in fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse
downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications.
However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques
presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational
costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed
Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been
adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long
Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure
comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged
sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity;
Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to
handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and
Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and
coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive
evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a
$2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements
in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

*Mohan Zhang,Yihua Zhang,Jinghan Jia,Zhangyang Wang,Sijia Liu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Deadlock Attack is a resource exhaustion method that hijacks large reasoning models' generative control flow using malicious adversarial embeddings to induce perpetual reasoning loops, preventing models from concluding answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose a critical security vulnerability in large reasoning models where chain-of-thought reasoning introduces a new attack surface for resource exhaustion through perpetual thinking loops.

Method: Optimized adversarial embeddings encourage transitional tokens after reasoning steps, combined with backdoor implantation strategy to overcome the continuous-to-discrete projection gap and enable reliable attack activation through specific trigger tokens.

Result: Achieved 100% attack success rate across four advanced LRMs and three math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to maximum token limits while being stealthy and robust against existing mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: The findings reveal an underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning inefficiency, exposing critical risks in modern reasoning models.

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step
problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative
thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the
Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative
control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual
reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional
tokens (e.g., "Wait", "But") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from
concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the
continuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\"ive projections of adversarial
embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we
introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation
through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate
across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three
math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token
limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility
loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies
trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and
underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning
(in)efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gains is a federated learning approach that addresses open-world scenarios where new clients with new knowledge continuously join. It uses fine-grained knowledge discovery and adaptation while preserving source domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world federated learning involves continuous client participation with new knowledge, requiring both detection of new knowledge (discovery) and integration into global models (adaptation) without sacrificing existing performance.

Method: Splits model into encoder and classifier, uses fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation, and implements anti-forgetting mechanism to preserve source domain performance.

Result: Outperforms other baselines on multi-domain datasets across three typical data-shift scenarios, achieving better performance for both source-domain and target-domain clients.

Conclusion: Gains effectively handles open-set federated learning by balancing knowledge discovery and adaptation while maintaining source domain performance through its fine-grained approach and anti-forgetting mechanisms.

Abstract: Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed
total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL
process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two
critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and
integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing
research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices
source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a
fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains
splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing
features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while
classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we
develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation
techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an
anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance,
ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets
across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly
outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and
target-domain clients. Code is available at:

TL;DR: SAU-FNO combines self-attention, U-Net, and FNO for fast and accurate 3D IC thermal prediction, achieving 842x speedup over FEM methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE methods are too slow for iterative design, while existing ML approaches like FNO suffer from high-frequency information loss and require extensive high-fidelity data.

Method: Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator (SAU-FNO) framework that captures long-range dependencies and local high-frequency features, using transfer learning to fine-tune low-fidelity data.

Result: SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art thermal prediction accuracy and provides 842x speedup over traditional FEM methods.

Conclusion: SAU-FNO is an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations, minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Thermal management in 3D ICs is increasingly challenging due to higher power
densities. Traditional PDE-solving-based methods, while accurate, are too slow
for iterative design. Machine learning approaches like FNO provide faster
alternatives but suffer from high-frequency information loss and high-fidelity
data dependency. We introduce Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator
(SAU-FNO), a novel framework combining self-attention and U-Net with FNO to
capture long-range dependencies and model local high-frequency features
effectively. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune low-fidelity data,
minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets and speeding up
training. Experiments demonstrate that SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art
thermal prediction accuracy and provides an 842x speedup over traditional FEM
methods, making it an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations.

*Paul-Niklas Ken Kandora,Simon Caspar Zeller,Aaron Jeremias Elsing,Elena Kuss,Steffen Rebennack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LinearizeLLM is an agent-based framework that uses Large Language Models to automatically reformulate nonlinear optimization problems into linear equivalents, enabling their solution with linear optimization solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is currently manual and expertise-intensive, but essential for using linear solvers or specialized algorithms. This creates a barrier to efficient problem solving.

Method: The framework assigns each nonlinear pattern to specialized reformulation agents that are explicitly instructed to derive exact linear reformulations. These agents coordinate to assemble solver-ready linear models equivalent to the original nonlinear problems.

Result: The approach was evaluated on a dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the ComplexOR dataset. Results show that specialized LLM agents can successfully automate linearization tasks.

Conclusion: Specialized LLM agents can automate linearization tasks, paving the way for fully conversational modeling pipelines in nonlinear optimization.

Abstract: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is largely manual and
expertise-intensive, yet it remains essential for solving such problems with
linear optimization solvers or applying special-purpose algorithms. We
introduce \textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task
by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each
nonlinear pattern to a \textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly
instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity
pattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision
variables. The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model
equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a
dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the
established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems. We evaluate our
approach with several LLMs. Our results indicate that specialized LLM agents
can automate linearization tasks, opening a path toward fully conversational
modeling pipelines for nonlinear optimization.

*Yang Ba,Mohammad Sadeq Abolhasani,Rong Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how the geometric structure of training data affects machine learning performance, using persistent homology to quantify data diversity beyond traditional entropy measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While the importance of training data quality is well-established, the impact of data's geometric structure on model performance remains underexplored. The authors aim to understand how data richness and redundancy elimination influence learning outcomes.

Method: The researchers employ persistent homology to extract topological features from data within a metric space, providing a principled approach to quantify diversity that goes beyond entropy-based measures.

Result: The findings demonstrate that persistent homology serves as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing training data quality in AI systems.

Conclusion: Persistent homology offers valuable insights into data geometric structure and can significantly contribute to improving training data quality for machine learning and AI systems.

Abstract: High-quality training data is the foundation of machine learning and
artificial intelligence, shaping how models learn and perform. Although much is
known about what types of data are effective for training, the impact of the
data's geometric structure on model performance remains largely underexplored.
We propose that both the richness of representation and the elimination of
redundancy within training data critically influence learning outcomes. To
investigate this, we employ persistent homology to extract topological features
from data within a metric space, thereby offering a principled way to quantify
diversity beyond entropy-based measures. Our findings highlight persistent
homology as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing the training data that
drives AI systems.

*Wenyun Li,Zheng Zhang,Dongmei Jiang,Xiangyuan Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PALE is a novel framework for hallucination detection in LLMs that uses prompt-guided data augmentation and a Contrastive Mahalanobis Score metric to evaluate truthfulness without requiring human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of well-labeled datasets for hallucination detection in LLMs, which is critical for ensuring the reliability of LLM-generated content.

Method: Uses prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation to generate both truthful and hallucinated data. Introduces Contrastive Mahalanobis Score (CM Score) based on modeling distributions of truthful and hallucinated data in activation space using matrix decomposition.

Result: Achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming competitive baseline by 6.55%. The framework offers strong generalizability and practicality without requiring additional human annotations.

Conclusion: PALE provides an effective and practical solution for hallucination detection in LLMs through data augmentation and novel evaluation metrics, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI
community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been
found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as
hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to
ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in
hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing
both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce
Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework
that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for
hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and
hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more
effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings
produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive
Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions
of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a
matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying
structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require
additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality
for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE
achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the
competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

### [36] [DAWP: A framework for global observation forecasting via Data Assimilation and Weather Prediction in satellite observation space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15978)
*Junchao Gong,Jingyi Xu,Ben Fei,Fenghua Ling,Wenlong Zhang,Kun Chen,Wanghan Xu,Weidong Yang,Xiaokang Yang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAWP is a novel AI weather prediction framework that operates in observation space rather than reanalysis data, using an AI data assimilation module to handle irregular satellite observations and a spatiotemporal transformer for global forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current AI weather prediction methods that rely on reanalysis data, which suffer from data assimilation biases and temporal discrepancies, by enabling direct forecasting from observation data.

Method: Proposes DAWP framework with two key components: 1) AI data assimilation (AIDA) module using mask multi-modality autoencoder and mask ViT-VAEs to assimilate irregular satellite observations, 2) Spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning for learning dynamics in observation space and enabling sub-image-based global forecasting.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show AIDA initialization significantly improves AIWP rollout and efficiency. The framework demonstrates promising potential for global precipitation forecasting applications.

Conclusion: DAWP represents a transformative paradigm that liberates AI weather prediction from reanalysis data dependencies, enabling more direct and efficient forecasting from observational data through innovative data assimilation and spatiotemporal modeling techniques.

Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive
progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction
(AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data
limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and
temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation
forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of
the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal
dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution
observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this
end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate
in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial
intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module
applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular
satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a
spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning
(CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based
global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA
initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP.
Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in
global precipitation forecasting.

*Coen Adler,Yuxin Chang,Felix Draxler,Samar Abdi,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the calibration properties of time series foundation models, finding they are better calibrated than baselines and don't show systematic overconfidence like other deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite foundation models achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance for time series data, their calibration properties remain underexplored, even though calibration is critical for many practical applications.

Method: Systematic evaluation of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines, assessing model calibration, effects of varying prediction heads, and calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting.

Result: Time series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, unlike the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

Conclusion: Time series foundation models demonstrate superior calibration properties compared to baseline approaches, addressing a key limitation of traditional deep learning models in time series forecasting.

Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for time series data has
generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of
applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive
performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored,
despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical
applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties
of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We
perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e.,
over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and
calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time
series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline
models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in
contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

### [38] [Cog-Rethinker: Hierarchical Metacognitive Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15979)
*Zexu Sun,Yongcheng Zeng,Erxue Min,Heyang Gao,Bokai Ji,Xu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cog-Rethinker is a hierarchical metacognitive RL framework that improves sample efficiency in LLM reasoning by decomposing zero-accuracy problems and refining wrong solutions, outperforming baseline methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for LLM reasoning suffer from sampling inefficiencies, particularly for weak LLMs where most problems generate invalid outputs during accuracy-driven filtration, wasting samples.

Method: A two-stage hierarchical metacognitive framework: 1) decomposes zero-accuracy problems into subproblems, and 2) refines answers by referencing previous wrong solutions. Uses supervised fine-tuning to enable cold-start and maintain train-test consistency.

Result: Superior performance on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks and improved sample efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Cog-Rethinker effectively addresses sampling inefficiency in RL training for LLM reasoning through hierarchical metacognitive processing, demonstrating both performance improvements and faster convergence.

Abstract: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable
inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable
reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models.
Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous
works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt
templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for
weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during
accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples.
To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical
metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses
on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our
Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive
two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems,
firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems
to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in
previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by
referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two
new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt
templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using
correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental
results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample
efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

### [39] [Narrowing Action Choices with AI Improves Human Sequential Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16097)
*Eleni Straitouri,Stratis Tsirtsis,Ander Artola Velasco,Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decision support system that uses a pre-trained AI agent to narrow down action choices for humans in sequential decision making, achieving complementarity where human-AI teams outperform either alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the principle of adaptive human agency control from classification tasks to sequential decision making, aiming to achieve complementarity where human-AI collaboration outperforms individual performance.

Method: Developed a decision support system that uses a pre-trained AI agent to restrict human action choices to a subset, combined with a bandit algorithm that optimizes human agency level by leveraging action set smoothness properties.

Result: In a large-scale human study (n=1,600) using a wildfire mitigation game, participants using the system outperformed those playing alone by ~30% and the AI agent by >2%, despite the AI agent significantly outperforming unsupported humans.

Conclusion: The proposed decision support system successfully achieves complementarity in sequential decision making by adaptively controlling human agency through action set narrowing, demonstrating significant performance improvements over individual human or AI performance.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, in classification tasks, it is possible to design
decision support systems that do not require human experts to understand when
to cede agency to a classifier or when to exercise their own agency to achieve
complementarity$\unicode{x2014}$experts using these systems make more accurate
predictions than those made by the experts or the classifier alone. The key
principle underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the
level of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve
complementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer
this question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a
pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a
subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along
the way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness
properties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize
the level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct
a large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a
wildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported
by our system outperform those who play on their own by $\sim$$30$% and the AI
agent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely
outperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the
data gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source
implementation of our system at

*Donghyeok Shin,Yeongmin Kim,Suhyeon Jo,Byeonghu Na,Il-Chul Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes AMiD, a unified knowledge distillation framework using Œ±-mixture assistant distributions to address capacity gaps and training instability in LLM distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive LLMs have high computational costs, and existing knowledge distillation methods suffer from capacity gaps and training instability due to near-zero probabilities in high-dimensional outputs.

Method: Introduces Œ±-mixture assistant distribution with a continuous parameter Œ± to generalize previous approaches, and AMiD framework that generalizes divergence families based on optimality.

Result: AMiD demonstrates superior performance and training stability by leveraging a broader, theoretically grounded assistant distribution space.

Conclusion: The proposed Œ±-mixture assistant distribution and AMiD framework provide a systematic solution to overcome fundamental limitations in LLM knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs.
Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from
a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous
studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and
training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the
high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome
these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating
assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals
of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic
investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes
$\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of
assistant distributions, and $\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a
unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\alpha$-mixture
assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant
distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\alpha$, which
has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the
family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on
optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training
stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant
distribution space.

### [41] [A Minimal-Assumption Analysis of Q-Learning with Time-Varying Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16132)
*Phalguni Nanda,Zaiwei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First finite-time analysis of Q-learning with time-varying learning policies, showing O(1/Œµ¬≤) sample complexity matching off-policy Q-learning but with different exploration-exploitation trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous finite-time analysis of on-policy Q-learning under minimal assumptions, addressing the analytical challenges of time-varying policies and rapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise.

Method: Employed refined approach using Poisson equation to decompose Markovian noise into martingale-difference and residual terms, with sensitivity analysis of Poisson equation solution for time inhomogeneity control.

Result: Established last-iterate convergence rate for Q-function error and derived explicit rate for policy evaluation error, showing on-policy Q-learning has weaker exploration but better exploitation than off-policy counterpart.

Conclusion: On-policy Q-learning achieves optimal policy convergence with O(1/Œµ¬≤) sample complexity, and the developed analytical tools can facilitate analysis of other RL algorithms with time-varying policies.

Abstract: In this work, we present the first finite-time analysis of the Q-learning
algorithm under time-varying learning policies (i.e., on-policy sampling) with
minimal assumptions -- specifically, assuming only the existence of a policy
that induces an irreducible Markov chain over the state space. We establish a
last-iterate convergence rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
implying a sample complexity of order $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for achieving
$\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty] \le \epsilon$, matching that of off-policy
Q-learning but with a worse dependence on exploration-related parameters. We
also derive an explicit rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q^{\pi_k} - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
where $\pi_k$ is the learning policy at iteration $k$. These results reveal
that on-policy Q-learning exhibits weaker exploration than its off-policy
counterpart but enjoys an exploitation advantage, as its policy converges to an
optimal one rather than remaining fixed. Numerical simulations corroborate our
theory.
  Technically, the combination of time-varying learning policies (which induce
rapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise) and the minimal assumption on
exploration presents significant analytical challenges. To address these
challenges, we employ a refined approach that leverages the Poisson equation to
decompose the Markovian noise corresponding to the lazy transition matrix into
a martingale-difference term and residual terms. To control the residual terms
under time inhomogeneity, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the Poisson
equation solution with respect to both the Q-function estimate and the learning
policy. These tools may further facilitate the analysis of general
reinforcement learning algorithms with rapidly time-varying learning policies
-- such as single-timescale actor--critic methods and learning-in-games
algorithms -- and are of independent interest.

*Yizuo Chen,Adnan Darwiche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: State-based causal effects (interventions on specific states of treatment variables affecting specific states of outcome variables) can be identifiable even when variable-based causal effects are not, particularly when context-specific independencies and conditional functional dependencies are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether causal effects defined at the state level (specific values of variables) rather than the variable level can be identifiable in situations where traditional variable-based causal effects are not identifiable.

Method: Theoretical analysis of state-based causal effect identifiability, examining how additional knowledge such as context-specific independencies and conditional functional dependencies enables identifiability that variable-based frameworks miss.

Result: State-based causal effects may be identifiable even when variable-based effects are not, and this separation only occurs with additional structural knowledge. Knowledge constraining variable states alone doesn't improve identifiability but can enhance both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other structural knowledge.

Conclusion: State-based causal analysis can reveal estimable causal effects from observational data that existing variable-based frameworks would miss, highlighting the importance of considering finer-grained causal questions and leveraging additional structural knowledge.

Abstract: The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of
treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability
of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of
treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We
demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when
variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation
occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific
independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We
further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show
that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve
both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other
knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight
situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational
data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based
frameworks.

### [45] [Zeroth-Order Sharpness-Aware Learning with Exponential Tilting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16157)
*Xuchen Gong,Tian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper connects zeroth-order optimization with sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through an exponential tilting objective that bridges average-loss and max-loss formulations, proposing new gradient-free algorithms that achieve better generalization than vanilla zeroth-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between classic zeroth-order optimization (which optimizes smoothed functions) and SAM approaches (which focus on worst-case loss), providing a unified framework that transitions between average and max loss objectives.

Method: Develops an exponential tilting objective that smoothly transitions between average-loss and max-loss formulations, and proposes new zeroth-order algorithms to solve this soft SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter.

Result: The approach achieves better generalization compared to vanilla zeroth-order baselines across various tasks including classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation, while serving as a gradient-free and memory-efficient alternative to SAM variants.

Conclusion: The exponential tilting framework successfully connects zeroth-order optimization with SAM, providing precise characterizations of sharpness notions and practical gradient-free alternatives that improve generalization performance.

Abstract: Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a
smoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under
randomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the
loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the
largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.
In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding
objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting
objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the
max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft
SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise
characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.
Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient
alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to
vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including
classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.

### [46] [Algorithmic Primitives and Compositional Geometry of Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15987)
*Samuel Lippl,Thomas McGee,Kimberly Lopez,Ziwen Pan,Pierce Zhang,Salma Ziadi,Oliver Eberle,Ida Momennejad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for identifying and manipulating algorithmic primitives in LLMs that enable multi-step reasoning, showing these primitives form a compositional geometry in activation space and transfer across tasks and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how latent computations and inference time processes enable large language models to perform complex multi-step reasoning tasks, and to develop methods for tracing and steering these algorithmic building blocks.

Method: Developed a framework that links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns, operationalizes primitives by clustering neural activations and labeling matched reasoning traces, and uses function vector methods to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks.

Result: Primitive vectors can be combined through arithmetic operations, revealing geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task and cross-model evaluations show both shared and task-specific primitives. Reasoning-finetuned models exhibit more systematic use of verification and path-generation primitives, and injecting these vectors into base models induces behavioral changes.

Conclusion: LLM reasoning is supported by a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives that transfer cross-task and cross-model, and reasoning finetuning strengthens algorithmic generalization across domains.

Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models
(LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and
steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach
links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates
algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring
their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four
benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph
navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and
labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods
to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of
reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and
scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task
and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both
shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its
reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after
finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and
path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in
Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning.
Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by
a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer
cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens
algorithmic generalization across domains.

*Ankitkumar Joshi,Milos Hauskrecht*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRUwE is a simple yet effective RNN-based model for irregularly sampled multivariate time series that achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while being easier to implement and more computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if simpler RNN-based architectures can still be competitive with complex learning methods for irregular time series prediction, and to provide an efficient solution for domains like healthcare and sensor networks.

Method: Proposes GRUwE (Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential basis functions) that maintains a Markov state representation updated via two reset mechanisms: observation-triggered reset and time-triggered reset using learnable exponential decays.

Result: GRUwE achieves competitive to superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art methods on next-observation and next-event prediction tasks across several real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: GRUwE demonstrates that simpler RNN-based approaches can still be highly effective for irregular time series prediction, offering advantages in implementation simplicity, minimal hyper-parameter tuning, and computational efficiency for online deployment.

Abstract: Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent
challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works
have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the
prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear
what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever
modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still
competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In
this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential
basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made
at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based
predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state
representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular
observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)
observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state
using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous
time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on
next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can
indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers
compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal
hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational
overhead in the online deployment.

### [48] [Can GRPO Help LLMs Transcend Their Pretraining Origin?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15990)
*Kangqi Ni,Zhen Tan,Zijie Liu,Pingzhi Li,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) in RLVR improves LLM reasoning inconsistently - it only enhances capabilities that align with the model's pretraining biases and cannot discover novel solutions beyond the base distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why GRPO shows inconsistent performance gains across different reasoning domains and determine the conditions under which it improves reasoning and generalizes out-of-distribution.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving GRPO is a conservative reweighting scheme bounded by base model distribution, plus controlled experiments training transformers from scratch to evaluate generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token representation, and compositionality.

Result: GRPO only improves OOD performance when target tasks align with model's pretrained biases. In-distribution gains diminish as performance saturates. GRPO cannot discover completely novel solutions beyond the base distribution.

Conclusion: GRPO is not a universal reasoning enhancer but rather a tool that sharpens pretraining biases. Future algorithms should focus on expanding model capabilities beyond pretraining origins.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by
the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach
for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model
may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet
remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a
critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and
generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data
distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a
conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and
thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in
carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,
evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token
representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled
explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target
task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution
(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a
universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.
Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a
model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stratos is an automated LLM distillation pipeline that selects optimal cloud servers, matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies to meet user constraints on performance and budget, achieving 4x accuracy improvement over GPT-4o on domain-specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing industrial demand for customized, cost-efficient LLMs for vertical domain tasks with constraints like latency and budget, with existing distillation frameworks requiring manual intervention and struggling with complex requirements.

Method: End-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server/model selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud environments, using Pareto-optimal server selection, dynamic teacher-student matching, and adaptive distillation strategies based on task complexity.

Result: Achieved 4x accuracy improvement over GPT-4o teacher baseline on rare Mahjong reasoning task using reverse synthetic data and knowledge injection, with reduced latency and cost without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Stratos shows promise for efficient vertical-domain LLM deployment by automating complex distillation processes and optimizing cloud hosting while meeting user-defined constraints.

Abstract: The growing industrial demand for customized and cost-efficient large
language models (LLMs) is fueled by the rise of vertical, domain-specific tasks
and the need to optimize performance under constraints such as latency and
budget. Knowledge distillation, as an efficient model compression and transfer
technique, offers a feasible solution. However, existing distillation
frameworks often require manual intervention and struggle to meet such complex
user-defined distillation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose Stratos,
an end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server and model
selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud
environments. Given user-defined constraints on model performance and system
budget, Stratos automatically selects Pareto-optimal servers, dynamically
matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies based on task
complexity to optimize cloud hosting. Experiments show that Stratos produces a
student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher
baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse
synthetic data and knowledge injection. Moreover, it achieves reduced latency
and cost without compromising accuracy. These results highlight its promise for
vertical-domain LLM deployment.

### [50] [Expressive Reward Synthesis with the Runtime Monitoring Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16185)
*Daniel Donnelly,Angelo Ferrando,Francesco Belardinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces language-based Reward Machines that extend traditional Reward Machines using Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to handle non-regular, non-Markovian tasks through built-in memory capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL reward functions are black-box mappings that lack interpretability and cannot capture complex behaviors like counting or parameterized conditions. Reward Machines address some limitations but are bounded by regular languages.

Method: Developed a novel class of language-based Reward Machines by building on Runtime Monitoring Language (RML), leveraging its built-in memory to specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian tasks.

Result: The approach demonstrates enhanced expressiveness through experiments, showing advantages in flexible event-handling and task specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

Conclusion: Language-based Reward Machines using RML provide a more expressive framework for specifying complex reward functions in reinforcement learning, overcoming limitations of traditional Reward Machines.

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification,
whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly
harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as
black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in
many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are
given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address
this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling
the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their
expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to
capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In
this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel
class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of
RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian
tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments,
highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task
specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

### [51] [Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distance for Measuring Distribution Shift in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15996)
*Ozan K. Tonguz,Federico Taschin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test to measure distribution shift between training and test data, showing that even small KS distances (0.02) can cause significant performance degradation (50% travel time increase) in AI transportation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical problem of distribution shift between training and test data in ML/AI systems, which can lead to large prediction errors and safety/reliability issues, particularly in applications like smart transportation.

Method: Propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test for measuring distribution shift, using KS distance to quantify the shift and its impact on AI agent performance.

Result: Results show that even a small KS distance of 0.02 can lead to about 50% increase in travel time at a single intersection when using a Reinforcement Learning agent, demonstrating significant performance degradation.

Conclusion: KS Test and KS distance can serve as valuable statistical tools for real-time monitoring of distribution shift in AI systems, enabling more informed coping strategies for AI agents dealing with distribution shifts in applications like smart transportation.

Abstract: One of the major problems in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is the fact that the probability distribution of the test
data in the real world could deviate substantially from the probability
distribution of the training data set. When this happens, the predictions of an
ML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome
and undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML
systems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be
critical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal
with this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability
distribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this
deviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance
can be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's
performance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable
statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More
specifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about
50\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement
Learning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test
and KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step
forward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and
this, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a
more informed manner.

*Sunmook Choi,Yahya Sattar,Yassir Jedra,Maryam Fazel,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an explore-then-commit algorithm for nonstationary bandits with action-dependent linear state dynamics, achieving √ï(T^{2/3}) regret by first estimating system parameters through random exploration, then optimizing long-term action sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tension between short-term and long-term rewards in bandit problems where rewards depend on both actions and latent states governed by unknown linear dynamics that also depend on actions.

Method: An explore-then-commit algorithm with random Rademacher actions during exploration to estimate Markov parameters, followed by optimized action sequence design using estimated parameters for long-term reward maximization.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves √ï(T^{2/3}) regret, with analysis providing near-optimal sample complexity for system identification and sub-optimality guarantees for the NP-hard indefinite quadratic optimization problem.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses challenges of learning from temporally correlated rewards and designing optimal long-term action sequences, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical implementation via semidefinite relaxation with Goemans-Williamson rounding.

Abstract: We study a nonstationary bandit problem where rewards depend on both actions
and latent states, the latter governed by unknown linear dynamics. Crucially,
the state dynamics also depend on the actions, resulting in tension between
short-term and long-term rewards. We propose an explore-then-commit algorithm
for a finite horizon $T$. During the exploration phase, random Rademacher
actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics,
which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the
algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence
for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges:
learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences
with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing
near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using
bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence
with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard
problem. We provide a sub-optimality guarantee for this problem, enabling our
regret upper bound. Lastly, we propose a semidefinite relaxation with
Goemans-Williamson rounding as a practical approach.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that natural gradient methods can significantly
outperform standard optimizers when training physics-informed neural networks

with ANaGRAM, a natural-gradient-inspired approach employing singular value
decomposition with cutoff regularization. Building on this analysis, we propose
a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy that further enhances ANaGRAM's performance.
Experiments on benchmark PDEs validate the effectiveness of our method, which
allows to reach machine precision on some experiments. To provide theoretical
grounding, we develop a framework based on spectral theory that explains the
necessity of regularization and extend previous shown connections with Green's
functions theory.

Motivation: Label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets that affects model training and validation, but there's no clear consensus on optimal approaches for detecting noisy labels.

Method: Decompose detection methods into three fundamental components: label agreement function, aggregation method, and information gathering approach (in-sample vs out-of-sample). Propose a unified benchmark task of detecting training samples equal to the dataset's noise rate with a novel false negative rate metric.

Result: In-sample information gathering using average probability aggregation combined with the logit margin as the label agreement function achieves the best results across most scenarios in both vision and tabular datasets under synthetic and real-world noise conditions.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidance for designing new detection methods and selecting techniques for specific applications, with the identified combination performing optimally across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, affecting both model
training and validation. Clean data are essential for achieving strong
performance and ensuring reliable evaluation. While various techniques have
been proposed to detect noisy labels, there is no clear consensus on optimal
approaches. We perform a comprehensive benchmark of detection methods by
decomposing them into three fundamental components: label agreement function,
aggregation method, and information gathering approach (in-sample vs
out-of-sample). This decomposition can be applied to many existing detection
methods, and enables systematic comparison across diverse approaches. To fairly
compare methods, we propose a unified benchmark task, detecting a fraction of
training samples equal to the dataset's noise rate. We also introduce a novel
metric: the false negative rate at this fixed operating point. Our evaluation
spans vision and tabular datasets under both synthetic and real-world noise
conditions. We identify that in-sample information gathering using average
probability aggregation combined with the logit margin as the label agreement
function achieves the best results across most scenarios. Our findings provide
practical guidance for designing new detection methods and selecting techniques
for specific applications.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a layer-aware online estimator for dynamic data influence during training, using only loss-to-output gradients to efficiently track how sample importance changes throughout optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-centric approaches focus on static influence measurements after model convergence, ignoring the dynamic nature of sample importance during training, especially in deep models. Existing methods are computationally expensive for frequent influence estimation.

Method: Developed a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output gradients, avoiding parameter-level and full-network gradients while maintaining ranking accuracy of sample influence.

Result: Extensive experiments across LLM pretraining, fine-tuning, and image classification demonstrate improved accuracy with significantly reduced time and memory costs compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient and scalable dynamic data curation in practice by providing a computationally lightweight approach to track changing sample influence during model optimization.

Abstract: Data-centric learning emphasizes curating high-quality training samples to
boost performance rather than designing new architectures. A central problem is
to estimate the influence of training sample efficiently. Prior studies largely
focus on static influence measured on a converged model, overlooking how data
valuation dynamically changes during optimization. This omission neglects the
dynamic nature of sample influence during optimization, especially in deep
models. To address the computational burden of frequent influence estimation,
we develop a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output
gradients. This design avoids parameter-level and full-network gradients while
preserving ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments across LLM pretraining,
fine-tuning, and image classification show our method improves accuracy with
substantially lower time and memory cost, making dynamic data curation
efficient and scalable in practice.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes one-bit weight quantization in neural networks using the Random Features model, proving that quantizing all layers except the last incurs no asymptotic loss in generalization error compared to full precision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent neural network advances create high computational and memory demands, creating interest in one-bit weight compression for efficient inference on resource-constrained devices, but the theoretical foundations of such compression remain poorly understood.

Method: The authors analyze one-bit quantization using the Random Features model, which corresponds to neural networks with random representations, and provide theoretical proofs about generalization error.

Result: The analysis proves that asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last layer incurs no loss in generalization error compared to full precision models. Empirical results show significant inference speedups on laptop GPUs.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical insights into neural network compression and demonstrates practical benefits through significant inference speed improvements, while offering more general results than previous literature in this area.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural networks have led to significant computational and
memory demands, spurring interest in one-bit weight compression to enable
efficient inference on resource-constrained devices. However, the theoretical
underpinnings of such compression remain poorly understood. We address this gap
by analyzing one-bit quantization in the Random Features model, a simplified
framework that corresponds to neural networks with random representations. We
prove that, asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last
incurs no loss in generalization error, compared to the full precision random

compression. We also demonstrate empirically that one-bit quantization leads to
significant inference speed ups for the Random Features models even on a laptop
GPU, confirming the practical benefits of our work. Additionally, we provide an
asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error for Random
Features with an arbitrary number of layers. To the best of our knowledge, our
analysis yields more general results than all previous works in the related
literature.

*Hanyin Cheng,Ruitong Zhang,Yuning Lu,Peng Chen,Meng Wang,Yang Shu,Bin Yang,Chenjuan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAR is a plug-and-play module that enhances Time Series Foundation Models' ability to handle state variables (discrete/categorical data) in multivariate time series anomaly detection, addressing the limitation of existing models that treat state variables uniformly with numerical variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Time Series Foundation Models overlook the distinct categorical nature of state variables (e.g., valve on/off, day of week) and their critical role as conditions, treating them uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling prevents full utilization of state information and can degrade detection performance when state variables are integrated.

Method: STAR comprises three core components: (1) Identity-guided State Encoder with learnable State Memory to capture categorical semantics of state variables, (2) Conditional Bottleneck Adapter that dynamically generates low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on current state, and (3) Numeral-State Matching module to detect anomalies in state variables themselves.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve the performance of existing Time Series Foundation Models on Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection.

Conclusion: STAR effectively addresses the critical limitation of existing TSFMs in handling state variables, providing a plug-and-play solution that enhances model capability to leverage state information during fine-tuning without requiring architectural changes to the backbone models.

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTSAD), however, in
real-world industrial scenarios, many time series comprise not only numerical
variables such as temperature and flow, but also numerous discrete state
variables that describe the system status, such as valve on/off or day of the
week. Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state
variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them
uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach
prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a
significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are
integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel
STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance
the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the
fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We
design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex
categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2)
We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates
low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby
flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model.
(3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively
detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive
experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve
the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.

Motivation: To address the high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization of AlphaFold's 48-block Evoformer architecture by leveraging Neural ODEs for continuous-depth modeling.

Method: Replace the 48 discrete Evoformer blocks with a Neural ODE parameterization that preserves attention-based operations, using the adjoint method for constant memory cost and adaptive ODE solvers for runtime-accuracy trade-offs.

Result: The Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces structurally plausible protein predictions and captures secondary structure elements like alpha-helices, though with slightly lower accuracy than the original. It achieves this with dramatically fewer resources (17.5 hours on single GPU).

Conclusion: Continuous-depth models offer a promising lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling, opening new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have
demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for
capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation.
However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces
high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural
Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth
formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural
ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This
continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the
adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and
accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure
prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces
structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary
structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate
the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this
performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on
a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a
lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work
opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction
frameworks.

### [59] [Decision-focused Sensing and Forecasting for Adaptive and Rapid Flood Response: An Implicit Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16015)
*Qian Sun,Graham Hults,Susu Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decision-focused framework for flood emergency response that integrates sensor placement, flood forecasting, and decision optimization to minimize response regrets under budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flood management systems use task-agnostic approaches for sensor placement and model training, overlooking how different configurations with similar sensing gains can lead to distinct decision outcomes in emergency response.

Method: End-to-end pipeline with four components: contextual scoring network, differentiable sensor selection under budget constraints, spatio-temporal flood reconstruction/forecasting model, and differentiable decision layer. Uses Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) for gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations.

Result: The framework enables strategic sensor placement and flood forecasting optimization specifically tailored to downstream decision-making tasks rather than generic metrics like information gain or average forecasting errors.

Conclusion: The proposed decision-focused approach provides a more effective solution for flood emergency response by directly optimizing for decision quality rather than intermediate metrics, addressing limitations of traditional task-agnostic methods.

Abstract: Timely and reliable decision-making is vital for flood emergency response,
yet it remains severely hindered by limited and imprecise situational awareness
due to various budget and data accessibility constraints. Traditional flood
management systems often rely on in-situ sensors to calibrate remote
sensing-based large-scale flood depth forecasting models, and further take
flood depth estimates to optimize flood response decisions. However, these
approaches often take fixed, decision task-agnostic strategies to decide where
to put in-situ sensors (e.g., maximize overall information gain) and train
flood forecasting models (e.g., minimize average forecasting errors), but
overlook that systems with the same sensing gain and average forecasting errors
may lead to distinct decisions. To address this, we introduce a novel
decision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ
sensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to
optimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline
integrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable
sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood
reconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer
tailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the
incorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable
gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic
decision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained
disaster response tasks.

*Fuqun Han,Stanley Osher,Wuchen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sparse transformer architecture that incorporates prior data distribution information through optimal transport theory, improving convexity and sparsity compared to classical flow-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transformer architectures by directly embedding prior knowledge about data distributions, addressing limitations of classical flow-based models in optimization convexity and sample sparsity.

Method: Proposes a sparse transformer design motivated by regularized Wasserstein proximal operators, which have closed-form solutions and naturally represent transformer architectures. This approach integrates optimal transport theory into neural network structure.

Result: The sparse transformer achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence to target distributions than neural ODE-based methods, as demonstrated through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems.

Conclusion: Incorporating optimal transport principles into transformer architectures through sparse designs improves optimization properties and sample quality, offering superior performance over traditional flow-based approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a sparse transformer architecture that incorporates
prior information about the underlying data distribution directly into the
transformer structure of the neural network. The design of the model is
motivated by a special optimal transport problem, namely the regularized
Wasserstein proximal operator, which admits a closed-form solution and turns
out to be a special representation of transformer architectures. Compared with
classical flow-based models, the proposed approach improves the convexity
properties of the optimization problem and promotes sparsity in the generated
samples. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including
applications in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems, we
demonstrate that the sparse transformer achieves higher accuracy and faster
convergence to the target distribution than classical neural ODE-based methods.

*Saeed Salehi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep reinforcement learning for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows, comparing progressive neural networks with conventional fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate deep reinforcement learning for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows by effectively transferring knowledge from low-fidelity to high-fidelity environments.

Method: Employed progressive neural networks (PNNs) for the first time in DRL-based flow control and conducted comprehensive benchmarking of conventional fine-tuning strategies using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system as a benchmark.

Result: PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior knowledge with consistent performance gains, while fine-tuning is sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting. PNNs remain effective even with substantial differences between source and target environments.

Conclusion: Progressive neural networks offer robust, scalable, and computationally efficient transfer learning for flow control, outperforming fine-tuning strategies and showing potential for application to more complex flow configurations.

Abstract: This work investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows.
Progressive neural networks (PNNs), a modular architecture designed to preserve
and reuse knowledge across tasks, are employed for the first time in the
context of DRL-based flow control. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking of
conventional fine-tuning strategies is conducted, evaluating their performance,
convergence behavior, and ability to retain transferred knowledge. The
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system is employed as a benchmark to examine how
knowledge encoded in control policies, trained in low-fidelity environments,
can be effectively transferred to high-fidelity settings. Systematic
evaluations show that while fine-tuning can accelerate convergence, it is
highly sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting.
In contrast, PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior
knowledge and providing consistent performance gains, and are notably robust to
overfitting during the pretraining phase. Layer-wise sensitivity analysis
further reveals how PNNs dynamically reuse intermediate representations from
the source policy while progressively adapting deeper layers to the target
task. Moreover, PNNs remain effective even when the source and target
environments differ substantially, such as in cases with mismatched physical
regimes or control objectives, where fine-tuning strategies often result in
suboptimal adaptation or complete failure of knowledge transfer. The results
highlight the potential of novel transfer learning frameworks for robust,
scalable, and computationally efficient flow control that can potentially be
applied to more complex flow configurations.

*Emmanuelle Claeys,Elena Kerjean,Jean-Michel Loubes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sequential reinforcement learning framework for imitation learning that models heterogeneous cognitive strategies in pollinators, particularly honeybees, addressing limitations of existing methods in capturing diverse learning behaviors and providing interpretability for biological insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure of state-of-the-art imitation learning methods in modeling heterogeneous cognitive strategies in pollinators, especially when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality, and to provide interpretability for biological analysis of decision-making strategies.

Method: Introduces a model that minimizes predictive loss while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral data, ensures full interpretability, and provides a mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under varying exploration-exploitation dynamics.

Result: The approach captures and forecasts behavior across individuals using distinct strategies (numerical cues, memory, environmental factors), successfully reproduces key decision patterns, and provides interpretable insights into pollinator decision-making. A novel dataset of 80 tracked bees under diverse weather conditions is released.

Conclusion: The framework sheds new light on learning strategies and memory interplay shaping pollinator decision-making, facilitates research on pollinator cognition, and supports ecological governance by improving simulations of insect behavior in agroecosystems.

Abstract: We introduce a sequential reinforcement learning framework for imitation
learning designed to model heterogeneous cognitive strategies in pollinators.
Focusing on honeybees, our approach leverages trajectory similarity to capture
and forecast behavior across individuals that rely on distinct strategies: some
exploiting numerical cues, others drawing on memory, or being influenced by
environmental factors such as weather. Through empirical evaluation, we show
that state-of-the-art imitation learning methods often fail in this setting:
when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality,
these models overlook both fast and slow learning behaviors and cannot
faithfully reproduce key decision patterns. Moreover, they offer limited
interpretability, hindering biological insight. Our contribution addresses
these challenges by (i) introducing a model that minimizes predictive loss
while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral
data, and (ii) ensuring full interpretability to enable biologists to analyze
underlying decision-making strategies and finally (iii) providing a
mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under
varying exploration-exploitation dynamics, and releasing a novel dataset of 80
tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions. This benchmark
facilitates research on pollinator cognition and supports ecological governance
by improving simulations of insect behavior in agroecosystems. Our findings
shed new light on the learning strategies and memory interplay shaping
pollinator decision-making.

*Sangjoon Lee,Haris Moazam Sheikh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AirDbM is a Design-by-Morphing approach that uses only 12 optimal baseline airfoils to reconstruct 99% of the UIUC database with high accuracy, outperforming previous methods in aerodynamic optimization and showing strong potential for machine learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient airfoil optimization method that explores diverse designs using minimal design variables while maintaining high reconstruction accuracy.

Method: AirDbM selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC database by sequentially adding baselines that maximize design capacity, then uses these for airfoil reconstruction and optimization.

Result: Reconstructs 99% of the database with mean absolute error below 0.005, achieves better Pareto front with higher hypervolume in multi-objective optimization, and shows superior adaptability for reinforcement learning agents compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: AirDbM effectively reduces design-space dimensionality while maintaining performance, demonstrating the broader potential of Design-by-Morphing approaches in machine learning-driven design applications.

Abstract: Effective airfoil geometry optimization requires exploring a diverse range of
designs using as few design variables as possible. This study introduces
AirDbM, a Design-by-Morphing (DbM) approach specialized for airfoil
optimization that systematically reduces design-space dimensionality. AirDbM
selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC airfoil database,
which contains over 1,600 shapes, by sequentially adding the baseline that most
increases the design capacity. With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 \%
of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the
performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In
multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence
and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the
previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are
discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances.
Furthermore, AirDbM demonstrates outstanding adaptability for reinforcement
learning (RL) agents in generating airfoil geometry when compared to
conventional airfoil parameterization methods, implying the broader potential
of DbM in machine learning-driven design.

### [64] [Structured Temporal Causality for Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16511)
*Dongchan Cho,Jiho Han,Keumyeong Kang,Minsang Kim,Honggyu Ryu,Namsoon Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OracleAD is a simple, interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection that models temporal dynamics through causal embeddings and captures spatial relationships via self-attention, identifying anomalies through prediction error and deviation from a stable latent structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled, while existing methods use complex architectures that detect only fragments of anomalies and overstate performance.

Method: Encodes each variable's past sequence into causal embeddings for joint prediction and reconstruction, uses self-attention to project embeddings into shared latent space capturing spatial relationships, aligns embeddings to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS), and employs dual scoring based on prediction error and SLS deviation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: OracleAD provides an effective, interpretable solution for multivariate time series anomaly detection that directly pinpoints root-cause variables through temporal causality violations.

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled.
Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures
tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and
overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and
interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly
detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal
embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input
window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a
self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture
spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are
modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The
projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS)
representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual
scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS,
enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across
individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from
embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD
directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD
achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and
evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for PV intraday trading that balances trading profit with imbalance penalties, outperforming benchmarks across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PV operators face uncertainty in generation and electricity prices, needing real-time position adjustments in continuous intraday markets to improve revenues and reduce imbalance costs.

Method: Feature-driven RL approach integrating data-driven features into state representation, formulated as Markov Decision Process with PPO algorithm using interpretable linear policies.

Result: Strategy consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios, shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and transparent decision rules with learned weights highlighting market microstructure importance.

Conclusion: Feature-driven RL offers practical, data-efficient, and operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV producers.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) operators face substantial uncertainty in generation and
short-term electricity prices. Continuous intraday markets enable producers to
adjust their positions in real time, potentially improving revenues and
reducing imbalance costs. We propose a feature-driven reinforcement learning
(RL) approach for PV intraday trading that integrates data-driven features into
the state and learns bidding policies in a sequential decision framework. The
problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances
trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained
on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy
consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios.
Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and
transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of
market microstructure and historical features. Taken together, these results
indicate that feature-driven RL offers a practical, data-efficient, and
operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV
producers.

*Dhruv Gupta,Aditya Nagarsekar,Vraj Shah,Sujith Thomas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces eDCF, a scalable and parallelizable method for robust intrinsic dimension estimation across scales using Connectivity Factor, achieving competitive performance with higher exact match rates under noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern datasets with high-dimensional features and complex dependencies require accurate intrinsic dimension estimation, but current methods struggle with scale-dependent noise effects where fine scales inflate estimates and coarse scales provide stable but potentially underestimated values.

Method: Proposes eDCF method based on Connectivity Factor (CF), a local connectivity-based metric, designed to be scalable and parallelizable for robust intrinsic dimension estimation across varying scales.

Result: eDCF consistently matches leading estimators with comparable MAE on synthetic benchmarks, achieves higher exact intrinsic dimension match rates (25.0% vs 16.7% for MLE and 12.5% for TWO-NN), excels under medium to high noise levels and large datasets, and accurately detects fractal geometries in decision boundaries.

Conclusion: The eDCF method provides robust intrinsic dimension estimation across scales, demonstrating superior performance particularly in noisy and large-scale scenarios, and proves effective for analyzing realistic structured data with complex geometries.

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain high-dimensional features exhibiting complex
dependencies. To effectively analyze such data, dimensionality reduction
methods rely on estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension (id) as a measure
of its underlying complexity. However, estimating id is challenging due to its
dependence on scale: at very fine scales, noise inflates id estimates, while at
coarser scales, estimates stabilize to lower, scale-invariant values. This
paper introduces a novel, scalable, and parallelizable method called eDCF,
which is based on Connectivity Factor (CF), a local connectivity-based metric,
to robustly estimate intrinsic dimension across varying scales. Our method
consistently matches leading estimators, achieving comparable values of mean
absolute error (MAE) on synthetic benchmarks with noisy samples. Moreover, our
approach also attains higher exact intrinsic dimension match rates, reaching up
to 25.0% compared to 16.7% for MLE and 12.5% for TWO-NN, particularly excelling
under medium to high noise levels and large datasets. Further, we showcase our
method's ability to accurately detect fractal geometries in decision
boundaries, confirming its utility for analyzing realistic, structured data.

### [67] [Breaking Memorization Barriers in LLM Code Fine-Tuning via Information Bottleneck for Improved Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16022)
*Changsheng Wang,Xin Chen,Sijia Liu,Ke Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a memorization barrier in fine-tuning LLMs for code generation, where strong memorization prevents learning new generalizable knowledge. It proposes IB-FT, an information bottleneck-guided approach that compresses memorized features while preserving task-relevant information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised fine-tuning of LLMs for code generation suffers from a memorization barrier where the model's strong memorization of downstream code data prevents effective acquisition of new, generalizable code knowledge.

Method: Proposes IB-FT (information bottleneck-guided fine-tuning) that applies an IB penalty on hidden representations of code data to compress spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information.

Result: IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves top-1 performance (Pass@1), and yields more stable gains under stricter multi-sample metrics (Pass@k^(m)) compared to conventional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The information bottleneck approach effectively overcomes the memorization barrier in code generation fine-tuning, leading to better performance and more stable improvements across different evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained large language models (LLMs) to code domains via
supervised fine-tuning (FT) has been commonly used for code generation.
However, we identify a previously underappreciated failure mode, the
memorization barrier, where strong memorization of downstream code data in the
base model could trap optimization and prevent the standard FT from effectively
acquiring new, generalizable code knowledge. To overcome this barrier, we
propose the information bottleneck (IB)-guided fine-tuning, termed IB-FT, which
applies an IB penalty on hidden representations of the code data to compress
spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information.
Extensive experiments on two code benchmarks (OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)
show that IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves
top-1 performance (Pass@$1$), and yields far more stable gains under the
stricter multi-sample metric Pass@$k^{(m)}$ (a problem counts as solved only if
at least $m$ of $k$ samples pass unit tests) compared with conventional FT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs' claimed causal discovery performance is inflated by benchmark memorization. The paper proposes using recent scientific studies for evaluation and shows hybrid methods combining LLM priors with statistical algorithms outperform pure approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the narrative that LLM-only methods outperform classical statistical approaches in causal discovery, and to address concerns about memorization in evaluations.

Method: Develops robust evaluation protocols using recent scientific studies released after LLM training cutoffs, and designs hybrid methods that combine LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics like the PC algorithm.

Result: LLMs perform far worse on curated graphs from recent publications compared to standard benchmarks like BNLearn. Using LLM predictions as priors for the PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both LLM-only and purely statistical methods.

Conclusion: The community should adopt science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal discovery methods that combine LLM knowledge with statistical approaches for real-world scientific inquiry.

Abstract: Recent claims of strong performance by Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal
discovery are undermined by a key flaw: many evaluations rely on benchmarks
likely included in pretraining corpora. Thus, apparent success suggests that
LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical
statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly
reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization
concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue
that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)
developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to
guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine
LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage
evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We
outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent
publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and
preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations.
Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy,
they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for
statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as
priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both
LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt
science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal
discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PolyConFM is the first polymer foundation model that uses conformation-centric generative pretraining to address limitations of existing methods that overlook global structural information in polymers. It decomposes polymer conformations into local repeating units and reconstructs them via masked autoregressive modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for polymers only use monomer-level descriptors and ignore global structural information from polymer conformations, limiting practical performance. The field lacks a universal foundation model for diverse downstream tasks.

Method: PolyConFM uses conformation-centric generative pretraining by decomposing polymer conformations into sequences of local conformations of repeating units. It employs masked autoregressive modeling to reconstruct local conformations and generate orientation transformations to recover full polymer conformations. A high-quality polymer conformation dataset was created via molecular dynamics simulations.

Result: Experiments show that PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods across diverse downstream tasks, providing a universal and powerful tool for polymer science.

Conclusion: PolyConFM successfully addresses the limitations of existing polymer modeling methods by incorporating global structural information through conformation-centric pretraining, establishing the first universal foundation model for polymer science that effectively supports multiple downstream applications.

Abstract: Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin
countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep
learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the
whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global
structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately
limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a
universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream
tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we
introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer
modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining.
Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of
local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM
under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local
conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating
their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer
conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation
dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby
enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that
PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on
diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and
powerful tool.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how parameter symmetry and network expressivity affect neural network generalization when learning real-space renormalization group transformations, using the central limit theorem as a test case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of physical symmetries in deep learning models and evaluate the principle of parameter symmetry breaking and restoration in hierarchical learning dynamics.

Method: Used multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) with varied weight symmetries and activation functions, analyzing generalization behavior through cumulant recursion relations and established frameworks for propagating cumulants through neural networks.

Result: Revealed competition between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or overconstrained models generalizing poorly. Demonstrated poor generalization analytically for constrained MLPs and empirically validated extension to GNNs.

Conclusion: Findings provide new insights into learning dynamics of symmetric networks and their limitations in modeling structured physical transformations, highlighting the delicate balance between symmetry and expressivity.

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple
layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data.
Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on
difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter
symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their
hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and
network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when
learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the
central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries
and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition
between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or
overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this
poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by
recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an
established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically
validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the
internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These
findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and
their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.

Abstract: We provide an accessible description of a peer-reviewed generalizable causal

causal effects can be estimated. We summarize the findings of the two
real-world applications of the approach to date as a demonstration of its
versatility and utility for medical discovery at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in differentially private linear regression methods that lack uncertainty quantification and synthetic data generation capabilities, particularly for small-to-medium continuous datasets common in social sciences.

Method: Proposes a DP bias-corrected estimator with asymptotic confidence intervals and a synthetic data generation procedure where regression on synthetic data matches DP regression results, using binning-aggregation strategy for small-to-moderate dimensions.

Result: Experiments show improved accuracy over existing methods, valid confidence intervals, and more reliable synthetic data for downstream machine learning tasks compared to current DP synthetic data generation approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations in current DP linear regression by providing valid inference and synthetic data generation capabilities suitable for small-to-medium continuous datasets in social sciences.

Abstract: In social sciences, small- to medium-scale datasets are common and linear
regression (LR) is canonical. In privacy-aware settings, much work has focused
on differentially private (DP) LR, but mostly on point estimation with limited
attention to uncertainty quantification. Meanwhile, synthetic data generation
(SDG) is increasingly important for reproducibility studies, yet current DP LR
methods do not readily support it. Mainstream SDG approaches are either
tailored to discretized data, making them less suitable for continuous
regression, or rely on deep models that require large datasets, limiting their
use for the smaller, continuous data typical in social science. We propose a
method for LR with valid inference under Gaussian DP: a DP bias-corrected
estimator with asymptotic confidence intervals (CIs) and a general SDG
procedure in which regression on the synthetic data matches our DP regression.
Our binning-aggregation strategy is effective in small- to moderate-dimensional
settings. Experiments show our method (1) improves accuracy over existing
methods, (2) provides valid CIs, and (3) produces more reliable synthetic data
for downstream ML tasks than current DP SDGs.

*Yingguang Yang,Xianghua Zeng,Qi Wu,Hao Peng,Yutong Xia,Hao Liu,Bin Chong,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes RoBCtrl, the first adversarial multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for social bot control attacks targeting GNN-based bot detectors, using diffusion models to generate realistic bot accounts and MARL to optimize attack strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vulnerability and robustness of existing social bot detection methods are underexplored, and current GNN-based approaches face challenges with limited control over social agents, black-box nature of detectors, and bot heterogeneity.

Method: Uses diffusion models to generate high-fidelity bot accounts by reconstructing existing data with minor modifications, then employs Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning to simulate adversarial bot behavior across different account categories based on influence and budget, with hierarchical state abstraction using structural entropy.

Result: Extensive experiments on social bot detection datasets show the framework effectively undermines the performance of GNN-based detectors.

Conclusion: The proposed RoBCtrl framework successfully demonstrates how adversarial attacks can compromise GNN-based social bot detection systems through realistic bot generation and strategic multi-agent control.

Abstract: Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for
individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered
considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous
detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these
detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited
control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the
heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the
first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot
control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.
Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts
by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby
evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving
social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social
accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then
employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the
attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a
hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to
accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot
detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the
performance of GNN-based detectors.

### [74] [Data Reliability Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17085)
*Yiling Chen,Shi Feng,Paul Kattuman,Fang-Yi Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to assess dataset reliability without ground truth by measuring how much reported data deviate from truth through the Gram determinant score, which is experiment-agnostic and preserves reliability orderings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate dataset reliability when ground truth is unavailable, especially for data from potentially strategic sources where true data are unobserved but outcomes of unknown statistical experiments are visible.

Method: Proposes the Gram determinant score that measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical distribution of observed data and experiment outcomes, preserving ground-truth-based reliability orderings.

Result: The Gram determinant score uniquely preserves reliability rankings regardless of the experiment (experiment agnosticism) and effectively captures data quality across synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data.

Conclusion: The Gram determinant score provides a robust method for assessing dataset reliability without ground truth access, maintaining consistent rankings across different observation processes and experimental conditions.

Abstract: How can we assess the reliability of a dataset without access to ground
truth? We introduce the problem of reliability scoring for datasets collected
from potentially strategic sources. The true data are unobserved, but we see
outcomes of an unknown statistical experiment that depends on them. To
benchmark reliability, we define ground-truth-based orderings that capture how
much reported data deviate from the truth. We then propose the Gram determinant
score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical
distribution of the observed data and experiment outcomes. We show that this
score preserves several ground-truth based reliability orderings and, uniquely
up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking of datasets regardless of
the experiment -- a property we term experiment agnosticism. Experiments on
synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data
demonstrate that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality
across diverse observation processes.

TL;DR: GCQ is a brain-inspired method that compresses observation-action sequences into discrete representations using grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics, enabling joint spatiotemporal compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient sequence modeling approach that can jointly compress space and time, inspired by grid-like patterns in neural systems, unlike conventional vector quantization methods that handle static inputs.

Method: Uses action-conditioned codebook with codewords derived from continuous attractor neural networks, dynamically selecting codewords based on actions to perform spatiotemporal compression.

Result: GCQ effectively compresses observation-action sequences into compact representations that support long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: GCQ provides both a computational tool for efficient sequence modeling and theoretical insights into grid-like code formation in neural systems, demonstrating superior performance in compact encoding and downstream applications.

Abstract: We propose Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ), a brain-inspired method for
compressing observation-action sequences into discrete representations using
grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. Unlike conventional vector
quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs
spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where
codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically
selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time,
serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports
long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact
encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool
for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation
of grid-like codes in neural systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First BOBW algorithms for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback, achieving O(log T) regret in stochastic and O(‚àöT) in adversarial settings, with matching lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused only on worst-case analysis; this paper initiates study of best-of-both-worlds algorithms that perform well in both stochastic and adversarial environments under challenging aggregate bandit feedback.

Method: Combination of FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators inspired by advances in online shortest path problems; extended to unknown-transition settings using confidence-based techniques.

Result: Algorithms achieve O(log T) regret in stochastic settings and O(‚àöT) regret in adversarial settings with known transitions, with matching lower bounds proving optimality; also provides first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds.

Conclusion: The paper successfully develops the first BOBW algorithms for episodic MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback, achieving near-optimal performance in both stochastic and adversarial environments with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We study online learning in finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes
(MDPs) under the challenging aggregate bandit feedback model, where the learner
observes only the cumulative loss incurred in each episode, rather than
individual losses at each state-action pair. While prior work in this setting
has focused exclusively on worst-case analysis, we initiate the study of
best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms that achieve low regret in both
stochastic and adversarial environments. We propose the first BOBW algorithms
for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known
transitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings
and ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish
matching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this
setting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by
incorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of
FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators
inspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems. Along the way, we
also provide the first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and demonstrate
near-optimal BOBW algorithms for shortest path problems with bandit feedback.

### [77] [AMS-QUANT: Adaptive Mantissa Sharing for Floating-point Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16045)
*Mengtao Lv,Ruiqi Zhu,Xinyu Wang,Yun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMS-Quant introduces non-integer bit-width floating-point quantization for LLMs, using mantissa-bit sharing and adaptive searching to achieve FP5.33 and FP4.25 formats, delivering 2.8-3.2x speedup over FP16 with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have massive parameters that create storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. While floating-point quantization helps reduce memory footprint and improve inference speed, existing approaches only use integer bit-widths, leaving potential optimization opportunities unexplored.

Method: AMS-Quant uses two key techniques: (1) Mantissa-bit Sharing - groups of k quantized weights share the least significant mantissa bit to approach minimum quantization bit-width without accuracy loss; (2) Adaptive Searching - offline optimization strategy to minimize accuracy degradation from sharing. The method is implemented as efficient CUDA Linear kernels to translate memory savings into actual latency reduction.

Result: The method successfully quantizes models to FP-5.33-e2m3 and FP4.25-e2m2 formats, achieving significant speedup over FP16 inference (2.8x and 3.2x respectively) with negligible accuracy loss on large-scale datasets and models.

Conclusion: AMS-Quant demonstrates that non-integer bit-width floating-point quantization is feasible and effective, providing substantial inference speed improvements for LLMs while maintaining model accuracy through innovative mantissa-bit sharing and adaptive optimization techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various kinds of tasks, while the billion or even trillion parameters bring
storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. Quantization, particularly
floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM
inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference
process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization
exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant,
to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two
novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing,
which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant
mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization
bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which
employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation
introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA
Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency
reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale
datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3
and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16
inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.

*Rishi Sonthalia,Raj Rao Nadakuditi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel regularization method for autoencoders using matricial free energy, which creates Gaussian-like codes that generalize well across datasets and can be applied to underdetermined inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a regularization scheme that ensures autoencoder codes have Gaussian-like properties and generalize effectively across training and test datasets, particularly for applications in underdetermined inverse problems.

Method: The method uses matricial free energy as a differentiable loss function based on the singular values of the code matrix. It minimizes negative matricial free energy through stochastic gradient-based training to achieve codes with singular value distributions matching those of Gaussian random matrices.

Result: Empirical simulations show that minimizing the negative matricial free energy produces Gaussian-like codes that generalize well across training and test sets. The approach also enables reliable production of Gaussian codes through matricidal free energy maximizing autoencoders.

Conclusion: The matricial free energy regularization successfully creates autoencoders with Gaussian-like codes that generalize effectively, providing a valuable tool for applications in underdetermined inverse problems where such properties are beneficial.

Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on
matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in
terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size).
From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss
achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix
coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d.
Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the
negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based
training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test
sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy
maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its
application to underdetermined inverse problems.

*Sofiya Garkot,Maksym Shamrai,Ivan Synytsia,Mariya Hirna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUIrilla is an automated framework for collecting GUI interaction data on macOS using accessibility APIs, creating a large-scale dataset (GUIrilla-Task) that improves LLM-based UI automation performance with significantly less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the data scarcity challenge in GUI automation by providing scalable data collection for desktop environments, particularly macOS which is underrepresented in current UI datasets.

Method: Systematically explores applications via native accessibility APIs, organizes interface elements into hierarchical GUI graphs, and uses specialized interaction handlers for comprehensive coverage.

Result: Created GUIrilla-Task dataset with 27,171 tasks across 1,108 macOS apps, showing that LLMs tuned on this data outperform synthetic baselines on ScreenSpot Pro benchmark using 97% less data.

Conclusion: GUIrilla provides an effective solution for scalable GUI data collection, enabling improved desktop automation through accessible, reproducible frameworks and datasets.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of operating complex graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) have the potential to transform desktop automation. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved UI
understanding, navigating full-window, multi-application desktop environments
remains a major challenge. Data availability is limited by costly manual
annotation, closed-source datasets and surface-level synthetic pipelines. We
introduce GUIrilla, an automated scalable framework that systematically
explores applications via native accessibility APIs to address the critical
data collection challenge in GUI automation. Our framework focuses on macOS -
an ecosystem with limited representation in current UI datasets - though many
of its components are designed for broader cross-platform applicability.
GUIrilla organizes discovered interface elements and crawler actions into
hierarchical GUI graphs and employs specialized interaction handlers to achieve
comprehensive application coverage. Using the application graphs from GUIrilla
crawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of
27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each
annotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility
metadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning
LLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on
downstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro
benchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source
library for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along
with the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold
benchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy.

*Chenyang Yu,Xinpeng Xie,Yan Huang,Chenxi Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses traffic forecasting using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and highlights the limitations of current approaches that rely on manually engineered event features, which struggle with generalization to diverse unknown events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate traffic forecasting is crucial for Intelligent Transportation Systems to improve urban resource allocation and travel experiences. With increasing urbanization and traffic congestion, there's a need for reliable forecasting models that can handle complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data.

Method: The paper reviews current deep learning approaches, particularly GNNs like STGCN, GraphWaveNet, STWave, and D2STGNN, which capture spatial dependencies in road networks and temporal evolution patterns. However, current methods rely heavily on manually engineered event features and domain expert knowledge.

Result: Existing GNN-based approaches have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic datasets and are effective at capturing periodic traffic patterns, but they struggle with generalization to diverse and complex unknown events due to their reliance on manual feature engineering.

Conclusion: Current traffic forecasting methods using GNNs are effective for regular patterns but limited by their dependence on manually engineered event features, which hinders their ability to generalize to unknown events and results in loss of semantic details.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and
improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has
intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting
models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can
effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and
dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models
such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including
STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic
datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional
structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular
effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by
periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored
various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied
on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced
manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for
different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat
enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy
reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse
and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often
lead to the loss of rich semantic details.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADCMs is a unified framework for automatic and adaptive discretization of Consistency Models, using local consistency as optimization objective and global consistency as constraint to improve training efficiency and generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Consistency Models rely on manually designed discretization schemes that require repeated adjustments for different noise schedules and datasets, which is inefficient and suboptimal.

Method: Formulate discretization as an optimization problem using local consistency as objective and global consistency as constraint with Lagrange multiplier. Achieve adaptive discretization using Gauss-Newton method.

Result: ADCMs significantly improve training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative performance with minimal training overhead on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and exhibit strong adaptability to advanced DM variants.

Conclusion: The proposed ADCMs framework provides an effective solution for automatic discretization in Consistency Models, enhancing training efficiency and performance while maintaining adaptability to different settings.

Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have shown promise for efficient one-step
generation. However, most existing CMs rely on manually designed discretization
schemes, which can cause repeated adjustments for different noise schedules and
datasets. To address this, we propose a unified framework for the automatic and
adaptive discretization of CMs, formulating it as an optimization problem with
respect to the discretization step. Concretely, during the consistency training
process, we propose using local consistency as the optimization objective to
ensure trainability by avoiding excessive discretization, and taking global
consistency as a constraint to ensure stability by controlling the denoising
error in the training target. We establish the trade-off between local and
global consistency with a Lagrange multiplier. Building on this framework, we
achieve adaptive discretization for CMs using the Gauss-Newton method. We refer
to our approach as ADCMs. Experiments demonstrate that ADCMs significantly
improve the training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative
performance with minimal training overhead on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
Moreover, ADCMs exhibit strong adaptability to more advanced DM variants. Code

*Anthony Frion,David S Greenberg*

TL;DR: This paper proposes a variational inference-based extension to deterministic machine learning for data assimilation, modeling predicted states as multivariate Gaussian distributions to handle uncertainty in chaotic systems like Lorenz-96.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data assimilation involves uncertainty when combining dynamical models with noisy, incomplete observations. Existing deterministic approaches need extension to properly handle uncertainty in predictions.

Method: The authors extend a deterministic machine learning approach using variational inference, where the predicted state follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This is tested on chaotic Lorenz-96 dynamics.

Result: The new model achieves nearly perfectly calibrated predictions and can be integrated into wider variational data assimilation pipelines, showing greater benefits from increasing data assimilation window lengths.

Conclusion: The proposed variational inference-based extension successfully handles uncertainty in data assimilation, providing well-calibrated predictions and improved performance with longer data assimilation windows in chaotic systems.

Abstract: Data assimilation, consisting in the combination of a dynamical model with a
set of noisy and incomplete observations in order to infer the state of a
system over time, involves uncertainty in most settings. Building upon an
existing deterministic machine learning approach, we propose a variational
inference-based extension in which the predicted state follows a multivariate
Gaussian distribution. Using the chaotic Lorenz-96 dynamics as a testing
ground, we show that our new model enables to obtain nearly perfectly
calibrated predictions, and can be integrated in a wider variational data
assimilation pipeline in order to achieve greater benefit from increasing
lengths of data assimilation windows. Our code is available at

*Armin Beck,Peter Ochs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends generalization guarantees to non-compact symmetries and non-invariant data distributions using PAC-Bayes framework, showing improved theoretical bounds and empirical validation on rotated MNIST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior theoretical guarantees for symmetries in ML mainly focused on compact group symmetries and assumed invariant data distributions, which rarely hold in real-world applications. The authors aim to extend these guarantees to more realistic settings.

Method: The authors build on the PAC-Bayes framework, adapting and tightening existing bounds to handle non-compact symmetries (like translations) and non-invariant data distributions. They demonstrate the approach specifically on McAllester's PAC-Bayes bound.

Result: The derived theoretical guarantees hold and improve upon prior results in experiments on a rotated MNIST dataset with non-uniform rotation group. The bounds apply to a wide range of PAC-Bayes bounds.

Conclusion: Symmetric models are preferable for symmetric data beyond the narrow setting of compact groups and invariant distributions, providing a more general understanding of symmetries in machine learning with theoretical evidence.

Abstract: Symmetries are known to improve the empirical performance of machine learning
models, yet theoretical guarantees explaining these gains remain limited. Prior
work has focused mainly on compact group symmetries and often assumes that the
data distribution itself is invariant, an assumption rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. In this work, we extend generalization guarantees to
the broader setting of non-compact symmetries, such as translations and to
non-invariant data distributions. Building on the PAC-Bayes framework, we adapt
and tighten existing bounds, demonstrating the approach on McAllester's
PAC-Bayes bound while showing that it applies to a wide range of PAC-Bayes
bounds. We validate our theory with experiments on a rotated MNIST dataset with
a non-uniform rotation group, where the derived guarantees not only hold but
also improve upon prior results. These findings provide theoretical evidence
that, for symmetric data, symmetric models are preferable beyond the narrow
setting of compact groups and invariant distributions, opening the way to a
more general understanding of symmetries in machine learning.

Motivation: The nonlinear AC optimal power flow problem is a major computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations, requiring faster and more efficient solutions.

Method: Uses topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC feature integration, trained with physics-informed loss to enforce AC power-flow feasibility and operational limits.

Result: 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC OPF solvers on 57-, 118-, and 2000-bus systems.

Conclusion: Residual learning provides a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major
computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we
propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC
OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections
required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a
topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC
feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC
power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-,
118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in
feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC
OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales
efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning
is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and
AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feature perturbation is a novel bandit algorithm that injects randomness into feature inputs rather than parameters or rewards, achieving improved regret bounds and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing randomized bandit algorithms suffer from suboptimal regret bounds (√ï(d¬≥/¬≤‚àöT)) and computational inefficiency due to parameter sampling, motivating a simpler approach.

Method: The method injects random perturbations directly into feature inputs instead of randomizing unknown parameters or adding noise to rewards.

Result: Achieves √ï(d‚àöT) worst-case regret bound for generalized linear bandits, outperforming existing methods with √ï(d¬≥/¬≤‚àöT) bounds, and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

Conclusion: Feature perturbation successfully unifies strong practical performance with best-known theoretical guarantees while being computationally efficient and extensible to non-parametric models.

Abstract: We propose feature perturbation, a simple yet powerful technique that injects
randomness directly into feature inputs, instead of randomizing unknown
parameters or adding noise to rewards. Remarkably, this algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ worst-case regret bound for generalized linear
bandits, while avoiding the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret
typical of existing randomized bandit algorithms. Because our algorithm eschews
parameter sampling, it is both computationally efficient and naturally extends
to non-parametric or neural network models. We verify these advantages through
empirical evaluations, demonstrating that feature perturbation not only
surpasses existing methods but also unifies strong practical performance with
best-known theoretical guarantees.

Motivation: Address the suboptimal communication efficiency in existing PFL methods that sustain substantial communication burdens, which impedes practical deployment, especially for edge intelligence systems with heterogeneous data sources.

Method: Propose FedPURIN framework that strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an integer programming formulation, integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme to reduce communication overhead.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse aggregation.

Conclusion: FedPURIN establishes a new paradigm for communication-efficient PFL that is particularly advantageous for edge intelligence systems operating with heterogeneous data sources, bridging the gap between model performance and communication efficiency.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research
frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel
model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate
statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter
decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in
PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods
remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede
practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with
Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that
strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an
integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is
seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant
communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive
evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID
conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse
aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for
communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence

Motivation: Time series data often suffer from corruption like missing values, noise, and outliers, which challenge forecasting and anomaly detection. Existing deep learning methods require extensive pretraining and struggle with distribution shifts.

Method: RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors with robust optimization, incorporating guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques to improve optimization stability and robustness.

Result: The framework achieves high recovery performance without requiring pretraining data and demonstrates resilience to outliers while relaxing Gaussian noise assumptions.

Conclusion: RINS-T provides a flexible and effective solution for complex real-world time series challenges, with code available for implementation.

Abstract: Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as
missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for
tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues,
inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted
data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep
learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require
extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In
this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series
Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high
recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages
neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization
techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on
Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and
robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization,
input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these
contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and
robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution
for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available

*Qinxuan Wang,Chuang Wang,Mingyu Zhang,Jingwei Sun,Peipei Yang,Shuo Tang,Shiming Xiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MNO is a multiscale neural operator for 3D CFD on unstructured point clouds that explicitly decomposes information across global, local, and micro scales using attention modules, achieving superior accuracy and scalability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators for PDEs suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, especially on irregular domains where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. Current approaches don't adequately capture the multiscale nature of fluid dynamics.

Method: MNO uses a three-scale decomposition: global dimension-shrinkage attention for long-range dependencies, local graph attention for neighborhood interactions, and micro point-wise attention for fine details. This preserves multiscale inductive biases while maintaining computational efficiency on 3D unstructured point clouds.

Result: MNO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across four diverse benchmarks (steady-state and unsteady flows with up to 300K points), reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems.

Conclusion: Explicit multiscale design is crucial for neural operators, and MNO establishes a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on irregular domains, highlighting the importance of capturing multiscale structures in CFD applications.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude
acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still
suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains
where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we
introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point
clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global
dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph
attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise
attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale
inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on
four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios
with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and
demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results
highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and
establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on
irregular domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stochastic DC optimization is widely used in machine learning but existing methods have poor convergence properties under small batch sizes, requiring large batches or strong noise assumptions that limit practical applicability.

Method: Proposed a momentum-based algorithm for stochastic DC optimization that works under standard smoothness and bounded variance assumptions of the concave part.

Result: Proved that without momentum, convergence may fail regardless of stepsize, while the momentum-based approach achieves provable convergence and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

Conclusion: Momentum is necessary and effective for enabling convergence in stochastic DC optimization under standard assumptions with any batch size, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Stochastic difference-of-convex (DC) optimization is prevalent in numerous
machine learning applications, yet its convergence properties under small batch
sizes remain poorly understood. Existing methods typically require large
batches or strong noise assumptions, which limit their practical use. In this
work, we show that momentum enables convergence under standard smoothness and
bounded variance assumptions (of the concave part) for any batch size. We prove
that without momentum, convergence may fail regardless of stepsize,
highlighting its necessity. Our momentum-based algorithm achieves provable
convergence and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Random Matrix Theory framework for analyzing Transformer training dynamics, identifying three training stages through spectral density evolution and proposing validation-free early-stopping criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanisms driving Transformer performance improvements and derive principled early-stopping criteria without relying on validation data.

Method: Using Random Matrix Theory to analyze the spectral density of shallow self-attention matrices, applying Power Law fits to identify training stages, and developing quantitative metrics for heavy-tailed dynamics and spectral signatures.

Result: The spectral density consistently evolves into heavy-tailed distributions, allowing demarcation of training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. The proposed criteria show strong alignment.

Conclusion: Random Matrix Theory provides effective tools for monitoring and diagnosing Transformer training progression, enabling principled early-stopping decisions without validation data.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for analyzing Transformer training dynamics. We focus on the
underlying mechanisms that drive performance improvements and derive principled
early-stopping criteria. Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of
the shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed
distribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we
demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed
structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides
guidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two
consistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed
dynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong
alignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring
and diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training.

*Jiayi Huang,Sangwoo Park,Nicola Paoletti,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CAb (Conformal Alignment-based) cascading for edge-cloud systems to ensure edge predictions maintain cloud-level conditional coverage while reducing cloud offloading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference but lacks reliability guarantees. The goal is to ensure edge predictions maintain the same conditional coverage probability as cloud models while minimizing cloud offloading.

Method: Formalizes conditional coverage with respect to cloud predictive distribution. Uses conformal alignment to cast edge-to-cloud escalation as multiple-hypothesis testing, selecting which inputs can be safely handled at the edge while maintaining statistical guarantees.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-100 and TeleQnA show CAb maintains target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially reducing cloud offloading and incurring modest increases in prediction-set size.

Conclusion: CAb cascading provides statistical guarantees on edge decisions satisfying cloud-level conditional coverage, offering tunable trade-offs among coverage, deferral rate, and set size.

Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models,
but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that
must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set,
it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if
produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to
the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based
(CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over
the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a
multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA)
to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb
model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of
edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure
applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal
prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate,
and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA
question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains
the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially
reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in
prediction-set size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient post-training quantization method that can handle various integer precisions (int8 to int1) for dense neural networks while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Formulates quantization as a QUBO problem using Frobenius distance between theoretical and dequantized outputs, then decomposes the global problem into independent subproblems of size f+1 that can be solved with heuristics like simulated annealing.

Result: Evaluated on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets across integer precisions from int8 to int1, showing improved performance compared to traditional round-to-nearest quantization.

Conclusion: The proposed ADAROUND-based QUBO formulation provides an effective and efficient approach for neural network quantization that outperforms traditional methods across various precision levels.

Abstract: This work introduces a post-training quantization (PTQ) method for dense
neural networks via a novel ADAROUND-based QUBO formulation. Using the
Frobenius distance between the theoretical output and the dequantized output
(before the activation function) as the objective, an explicit QUBO whose
binary variables represent the rounding choice for each weight and bias is
obtained. Additionally, by exploiting the structure of the coefficient QUBO
matrix, the global problem can be exactly decomposed into $n$ independent
subproblems of size $f+1$, which can be efficiently solved using some
heuristics such as simulated annealing. The approach is evaluated on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 across integer precisions from int8 to int1
and compared with a round-to-nearest traditional quantization methodology.

*Omer Haq*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Functional Distribution Networks (FDN) is a method that creates input-conditioned weight distributions to produce adaptive predictive mixtures, addressing overconfidence in neural networks under distribution shift through beta-ELBO training and Monte Carlo sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern probabilistic regressors often remain overconfident under distribution shift, highlighting the need for methods that can adapt predictive uncertainty to input conditions.

Method: FDN uses input-conditioned distributions over network weights to induce predictive mixtures with adaptive dispersion, trained with beta-ELBO and Monte Carlo sampling. An evaluation protocol separates interpolation from extrapolation and includes OOD sanity checks.

Result: The method was benchmarked against Bayesian, ensemble, dropout, and hypernetwork baselines under matched parameter and update budgets, assessing accuracy, calibration, and shift-awareness with standard diagnostics.

Conclusion: The FDN framework and evaluation protocol aim to make OOD-aware, well-calibrated neural regression practical and modular for real-world applications.

Abstract: Modern probabilistic regressors often remain overconfident under distribution
shift. We present Functional Distribution Networks (FDN), an input-conditioned
distribution over network weights that induces predictive mixtures whose
dispersion adapts to the input. FDN is trained with a beta-ELBO and Monte Carlo
sampling. We further propose an evaluation protocol that cleanly separates
interpolation from extrapolation and stresses OOD sanity checks (e.g., that
predictive likelihood degrades under shift while in-distribution accuracy and
calibration are maintained). On standard regression tasks, we benchmark against
strong Bayesian, ensemble, dropout, and hypernetwork baselines under matched
parameter and update budgets, and assess accuracy, calibration, and
shift-awareness with standard diagnostics. Together, the framework and protocol
aim to make OOD-aware, well-calibrated neural regression practical and modular.

### [94] [BPL: Bias-adaptive Preference Distillation Learning for Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16076)
*SeongKu Kang,Jianxun Lian,Dongha Lee,Wonbin Kweon,Sanghwan Jang,Jaehyun Lee,Jindong Wang,Xing Xie,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BPL is a new learning framework that uses dual distillation strategies to achieve high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments for recommender systems, addressing the bias problem in user preference modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems suffer from biases that incompletely reveal user preferences, and existing debiasing methods mostly focus on counterfactual test environments, degrading performance in factual test environments based on actual user interactions. Both test environments are important - counterfactual for long-term user satisfaction and factual for predicting subsequent user behaviors.

Method: BPL uses dual distillation strategies: 1) Teacher-student distillation from a biased model to retain accurate preference knowledge aligned with collected feedback for factual test performance, and 2) Self-distillation with reliability filtering to iteratively refine knowledge throughout training for better counterfactual test performance across broader user-item combinations.

Result: Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and counterfactual tests, demonstrating improved performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BPL successfully addresses the bias problem in recommender systems by gradually uncovering user preferences through dual distillation strategies, achieving high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments rather than sacrificing one for the other.

Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to
incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been
extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called
counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,
significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test
environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test
environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual
test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test
focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is
desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only
one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive
Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences
with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed
to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.
Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased
model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected
feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through
self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its
knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce
more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,
thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and
counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CONEC-LoRA is a novel approach for Domain Incremental Learning that combines task-shared and task-specific LoRAs with a stochastic classifier and auxiliary network to prevent catastrophic forgetting and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches create task-specific LoRAs but overlook shared knowledge across tasks, and rely on suboptimal classifiers that limit generalization performance in domain incremental learning scenarios.

Method: Proposes CONEC-LoRA with: 1) Consolidation between task-shared and task-specific LoRAs, 2) Stochastic classifier with parameters sampled from distributions, 3) Auxiliary network for optimal LoRA prediction, 4) Different-depth network structure with local classifiers, 5) Ball-generator loss and transformation module to address synthetic sample bias.

Result: CONEC-LoRA demonstrates significant advantages over prior methods, achieving over 5% improvement margins across 4 popular benchmark problems in domain incremental learning.

Conclusion: The proposed CONEC-LoRA framework effectively addresses domain incremental learning challenges by leveraging shared knowledge, stochastic classification, and intermediate representations, outperforming existing approaches substantially.

Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is a continual learning sub-branch that
aims to address never-ending arrivals of new domains without catastrophic
forgetting problems. Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared
knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during
inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely
on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization
powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank
adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed
from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and
task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing
approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose
parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of
correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed
to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the
concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is
connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate
representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and
transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our
rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in
4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.

*Jaehan Kim,Minkyoo Song,Minjae Seo,Youngjin Jin,Seungwon Shin,Jinwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PassREfinder-FL is a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing risks across websites using graph neural networks and federated learning, achieving high accuracy while preserving user privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credential stuffing attacks harm users who reuse passwords across websites. Existing detection methods compromise usability and face deployment challenges due to complex account-sharing mechanisms.

Method: Proposes password reuse relations as edges in a website graph, uses GNNs for link prediction, scales to arbitrary websites using public information, and incorporates federated learning to protect user privacy.

Result: Achieves F1-score of 0.9153 on real-world dataset of 360M breached accounts from 22,378 websites, with 4-11% performance improvement over other GNN models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively quantifies password reuse likelihood as actionable risk scores while maintaining user privacy through federated learning.

Abstract: Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who
frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has
attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login
attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password
creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing
mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we
propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing
risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --
defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and
represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),
we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between
sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by
incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as
nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a
federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user
sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset
of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that
PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further
validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over
other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we
demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse
likelihood as actionable risk scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation is difficult to implement in physical neural networks, so the authors aim to develop EP as a practical alternative for in-situ training of physical systems where control is limited to local parameters.

Method: Extend EP learning to discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems, particularly in weakly dissipative regimes. Test the method using driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics.

Result: Numerical studies on standard benchmarks (logical tasks and handwritten-digit recognition) demonstrate stable convergence of the method.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems where system control is restricted to local parameters, making EP applicable to a wide range of physical settings.

Abstract: Backpropagation learning algorithm, the workhorse of modern artificial
intelligence, is notoriously difficult to implement in physical neural
networks. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an alternative with comparable
efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to
both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to
previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative
regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even
without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be
replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative
exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical
task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence,
establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which
system control is restricted to local parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous MSA studies focused on complete multimodal data but ignored real-world modality missing issues due to occlusion, privacy constraints, and device malfunctions, leading to poor generalizability.

Method: Proposed de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization module to separate modalities into homogeneous, heterogeneous, and noisy representations with constraint paradigms, plus distribution-aligned self-distillation for bidirectional knowledge transfer.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on two datasets show FSRF has significant performance advantage over previous methods when dealing with uncertain missing modalities.

Conclusion: FSRF effectively mitigates the modality missing problem in MSA tasks through factorization and self-distillation techniques, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has become a research
hotspot that aims to utilize multimodal data for human sentiment understanding.
Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion
on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in
real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and
device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability.
  To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework
(FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task.
  Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization
module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous,
modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate
constraint paradigms for representation learning.
  Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that
fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge
transfer.
  Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a
significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing
modalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STABLE is a gated continual self-editing framework that uses LoRA-based parameter efficient fine-tuning to prevent catastrophic forgetting during sequential updates to LLMs. It evaluates edits against stability budgets using three metrics and gates updates through clipping or rejection when thresholds are exceeded.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need continual adaptation mechanisms without full retraining, but sequential updates can cause catastrophic forgetting where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge.

Method: Uses parameter efficient fine-tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with gating mechanism. Each edit is evaluated against stability budget using three metrics: Exact Match drop, bits increase, and KL divergence. Updates are rescaled through clipping or rejected if thresholds are exceeded.

Result: Experiments on Qwen-2.5-7B show gating effectively mitigates forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM-based gating achieved highest cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Different gating strategies achieve comparable distribution shift (KL divergence) but different accuracy outcomes.

Conclusion: STABLE offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Gating design is crucial for effective continual adaptation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require mechanisms for continual
adaptation without full retraining. However, sequential updates can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge.
This work presents STABLE, a gated continual self editing framework that
constrains forgetting during sequential updates using parameter efficient fine
tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see arXiv:2106.09685). Each candidate
edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i)
Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase,
reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying
distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is
exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected.
Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates
forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest
cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show
that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift
(measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes,
highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This
approach offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs
to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Code:

TL;DR: MemCom is a layer-wise compression method that improves memory and computational efficiency of many-shot in-context learning by compressing prompts into fewer soft tokens while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) benefit from more input examples in in-context learning but this incurs high memory and computational costs. Existing prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot scenarios, and simply using fewer shots is surprisingly strong but still inefficient.

Method: Proposed MemCom, a layer-wise compression method that uses stronger compressor models with more trainable parameters and compresses many-shot representations at each transformer layer to enable fine-grained compression.

Result: MemCom outperforms strong baselines across all compression ratios (3x to 8x) on multiple classification tasks with large label sets. While baseline performance degrades sharply (20-30%) at higher compression ratios, MemCom maintains high accuracy with minimal degradation (<10%).

Conclusion: Layer-wise compression with stronger compressor models is effective for many-shot prompt compression, enabling significant memory and computational efficiency gains while preserving task performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different
tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples /
demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of
examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs
higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to
improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing
the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to
generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing
prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and
simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve
effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more
trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot
representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression
by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these
insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically
evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different
model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence
lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms
strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks
with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at
higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy
with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.

Motivation: World models improve sample efficiency in RL, but typically require training. This paper explores whether a training-free approach using similarity search can match established models.

Method: Leverage similarity search and stochastic representations to approximate world model without training. Compare with PlaNet (Dreamer family) on latent reconstruction quality and image similarity.

Result: Search-based model is comparable to training-based model in next-step and long-horizon prediction. Shows stronger performance in long-horizon prediction across visually different environments.

Conclusion: Training-free world models using similarity search are viable alternatives to training-based approaches, particularly excelling in long-term predictions.

Abstract: World Models have vastly permeated the field of Reinforcement Learning. Their
ability to model the transition dynamics of an environment have greatly
improved sample efficiency in online RL. Among them, the most notorious example
is Dreamer, a model that learns to act in a diverse set of image-based
environments. In this paper, we leverage similarity search and stochastic
representations to approximate a world model without a training procedure. We
establish a comparison with PlaNet, a well-established world model of the
Dreamer family. We evaluate the models on the quality of latent reconstruction
and on the perceived similarity of the reconstructed image, on both next-step
and long horizon dynamics prediction. The results of our study demonstrate that
a search-based world model is comparable to a training based one in both cases.
Notably, our model show stronger performance in long-horizon prediction with
respect to the baseline on a range of visually different environments.

*Charles Rhys Campbell,Aldo H. Romero,Kamal Choudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic benchmark comparing three generative models (AtomGPT, CDVAE, FlowMM) for crystal structure generation using superconductivity datasets, with CDVAE performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous comparative evaluation of diverse generative architectures for materials discovery, addressing the lack of systematic benchmarks in the field.

Method: Trained three representative models (transformer-based AtomGPT, CDVAE, and Riemannian flow matching FlowMM) on superconductivity datasets and evaluated using KL divergence and MAE metrics for lattice parameters.

Result: CDVAE performed most favorably, followed by AtomGPT, then FlowMM, based on KL divergence and MAE scores for lattice parameter predictions.

Conclusion: The benchmark establishes performance rankings and provides publicly available code for reproducible evaluation of generative models in materials science.

Abstract: Generative models have become significant assets in the exploration and
identification of new materials, enabling the rapid proposal of candidate
crystal structures that satisfy target properties. Despite the increasing
adoption of diverse architectures, a rigorous comparative evaluation of their
performance on materials datasets is lacking. In this work, we present a
systematic benchmark of three representative generative models- AtomGPT (a
transformer-based model), Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE),
and FlowMM (a Riemannian flow matching model). These models were trained to
reconstruct crystal structures from subsets of two publicly available
superconductivity datasets- JARVIS Supercon 3D and DS A/B from the Alexandria
database. Performance was assessed using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between predicted and reference distributions of lattice parameters, as well as
the mean absolute error (MAE) of individual lattice constants. For the computed
KLD and MAE scores, CDVAE performs most favorably, followed by AtomGPT, and
then FlowMM. All benchmarking code and model configurations will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/atomgptlab/atombench_inverse.

### [103] [Alignment is Localized: A Causal Probe into Preference Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16167)
*Archie Chaudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) aligns language models by examining layer activations. The study finds that alignment is spatially localized in mid-layer activations rather than diffusely distributed across all parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RLHF has become popular for aligning language models with human preferences, the internal mechanisms of how this alignment is achieved remain unclear and opaque.

Method: The researchers systematically analyze preference optimization by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its tuned counterpart across human preference pairs, using Llama-3.2-1B and LASSO regression to identify key layers.

Result: Alignment is spatially localized in mid-layer activations that causally determine reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely unaffected. Only a small number of layers have non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward gains.

Conclusion: Alignment from human-based preferential tuning is a directional, low-rank process rather than diffuse and parametric, suggesting that model alignment occurs through specific, targeted changes rather than widespread parameter adjustments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human
annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference
fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain
set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human
Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework,
particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the
internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In
this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model
alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its
tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology
on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized:
mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines
reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely
unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number
of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward
gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from
human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather
than diffuse and parameteric.

### [104] [The Formalism-Implementation Gap in Reinforcement Learning Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16175)
*Pablo Samuel Castro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper argues that RL research should shift focus from demonstrating agent capabilities to advancing scientific understanding of reinforcement learning dynamics, and calls for more precise mapping between benchmarks and mathematical formalisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from concern that performance-focused RL research risks overfitting on academic benchmarks, making techniques less transferable to real-world problems, while diminishing work that improves understanding of learning dynamics.

Method: The paper uses the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) as an example benchmark to demonstrate how even "saturated" benchmarks can be effectively used for developing understanding and facilitating real-world deployment.

Result: The analysis shows that ALE, despite being considered saturated, remains valuable for understanding RL techniques and enabling their application to impactful real-world problems.

Conclusion: RL research should prioritize advancing scientific understanding over mere performance demonstration, and establish clearer connections between benchmarks and underlying mathematical formalisms to improve technique transferability.

Abstract: The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement
learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at
performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the
community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often
at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics.
Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic
benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult
to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly
diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at
improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:
(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent
capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of
reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our
benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular
Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a
benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be
effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the
deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

*Fateme Golivand Darvishvand,Hikaru Shindo,Sahil Sidheekh,Kristian Kersting,Sriraam Natarajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework combining relational reinforcement learning with object-centric representations to handle both structured and unstructured data, enhanced by active human guidance through policy uncertainty modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL systems operate on propositional tasks ignoring inherent problem structure, while relational extensions (RRL) make strong assumptions about problem structure. There's a need for a more flexible approach that can handle both structured and unstructured data effectively.

Method: Combines RRL with object-centric representation learning and incorporates active human guidance by explicitly modeling uncertainty over the policy, allowing the system to query human experts when needed.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach in handling both structured and unstructured data while benefiting from human guidance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between structured and unstructured data handling in RL, with active human guidance through uncertainty modeling proving to be an effective enhancement for learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has experienced a second wind in the past decade.
While incredibly successful in images and videos, these systems still operate
within the realm of propositional tasks ignoring the inherent structure that
exists in the problem. Consequently, relational extensions (RRL) have been
developed for such structured problems that allow for effective generalization
to arbitrary number of objects. However, they inherently make strong
assumptions about the problem structure. We introduce a novel framework that
combines RRL with object-centric representation to handle both structured and
unstructured data. We enhance learning by allowing the system to actively query
the human expert for guidance by explicitly modeling the uncertainty over the
policy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency
of our proposed approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study uses machine learning to predict climate policy progression in the European Green Deal, comparing text representation methods and finding that ClimateBERT performs best on text alone, while BERT with metadata achieves superior overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change requires effective legislative action, and this research aims to understand how machine learning can help track and predict the progression of climate policies from announcement to adoption.

Method: The study analyzes 165 policies with text and metadata, comparing text representation methods (TF-IDF, BERT, ClimateBERT) and incorporating metadata features to predict policy progression status using explainable AI techniques.

Result: ClimateBERT achieved the best performance on text features alone (RMSE = 0.17, R¬≤ = 0.29), while BERT with metadata features yielded superior overall performance (RMSE = 0.16, R¬≤ = 0.38). Explainable AI revealed key influencing factors like policy wording, political party, and country representation.

Conclusion: Machine learning tools show significant potential for supporting climate policy analysis and decision-making by predicting policy progression and identifying influential factors through explainable AI methods.

Abstract: Climate change demands effective legislative action to mitigate its impacts.
This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to understand the
progression of climate policy from announcement to adoption, focusing on
policies within the European Green Deal. We present a dataset of 165 policies,
incorporating text and metadata. We aim to predict a policy's progression
status, and compare text representation methods, including TF-IDF, BERT, and
ClimateBERT. Metadata features are included to evaluate the impact on
predictive performance. On text features alone, ClimateBERT outperforms other
approaches (RMSE = 0.17, R^2 = 0.29), while BERT achieves superior performance
with the addition of metadata features (RMSE = 0.16, R^2 = 0.38). Using methods
from explainable AI highlights the influence of factors such as policy wording
and metadata including political party and country representation. These
findings underscore the potential of ML tools in supporting climate policy
analysis and decision-making.

TL;DR: WEBSERV is a scalable web environment for RL agents that addresses limitations of existing systems by providing compact browser interaction and efficient server management, achieving SOTA performance with significantly reduced latency and storage requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL web environments have issues with excessive context noise, non-deterministic actions, and poor scalability for parallel training, creating a need for a more efficient and robust solution.

Method: Proposes WEBSERV with two components: 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment balancing context and action complexity, and 2) scalable RL environment with efficient web-server launching and resetting for parallel training.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates on WebArena shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks, with ~5x reduction in launch latency, ~240x reduction in storage needs, and support for 200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

Conclusion: WEBSERV provides an efficient and scalable solution for RL web agent training that significantly outperforms existing environments in performance, resource efficiency, and scalability.

Abstract: Training and evaluation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) web agents have gained
increasing attention, yet a scalable and efficient environment that couples
realistic and robust browser-side interaction with controllable server-side
state at scale is still missing. Existing environments tend to have one or more
of the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy
context; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI
or network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers
effectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that
includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context
and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching
and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We
evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving
state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by
~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling
200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel criterion for hyperedge disentanglement in hypergraph neural networks using category theory, and demonstrates its effectiveness in capturing gene functional relations in genetic pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few studies have explored disentangled representation learning for hypergraph-structured data, despite its potential to reveal hidden hyperedge semantics like unannotated node relations associated with labels.

Method: The paper analyzes hyperedge disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel disentanglement criterion derived from the naturality condition, implemented in a proof-of-concept model.

Result: The proof-of-concept model successfully captured functional relations of genes (nodes) in genetic pathways (hyperedges), demonstrating the potential of the proposed criterion.

Conclusion: The proposed category-theoretical approach to hyperedge disentanglement shows promise for leveraging hidden hyperedge semantics in hypergraph neural networks, particularly for applications like genetic pathway analysis.

Abstract: Despite the promising results of disentangled representation learning in
discovering latent patterns in graph-structured data, few studies have explored
disentanglement for hypergraph-structured data. Integrating hyperedge
disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage
hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that
are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge
disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel
criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition. Our
proof-of-concept model experimentally showed the potential of the proposed
criterion by successfully capturing functional relations of genes (nodes) in
genetic pathways (hyperedges).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes using SVD on QKV weight matrices with dynamic rank allocation and quantization to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead in Vision-Language Models, achieving >10% accuracy improvement with lower hardware cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models have high computational costs that limit scalability and real-time applicability due to large memory footprints and processing time.

Method: Leverage SVD over joint QKV weight matrices to reduce KV cache size, introduce dynamic rank allocation strategy, and apply quantization to both weights and activations.

Result: Achieves more than 10% accuracy improvement while consuming less hardware cost compared to approaches using only quantization or SVD.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables highly efficient VLMs suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are integral to tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering, but their high computational cost, driven by
large memory footprints and processing time, limits their scalability and
real-time applicability. In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value
Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight
matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition
introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the
SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction
in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach
by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a
highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely
solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy
improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time
deployment on resource-constrained devices. We open source our code at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaffAug is a scaffold-aware virtual screening framework that addresses class and structural imbalance in drug discovery using generative AI augmentation, self-training, and scaffold-diversity reranking to improve identification of novel active compounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Virtual screening faces three major challenges: class imbalance (low active rate), structural imbalance (certain scaffolds dominate), and the need to identify structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development.

Method: Three-module framework: 1) Augmentation module using graph diffusion model to generate synthetic data conditioned on scaffolds, 2) Model-agnostic self-training to integrate synthetic and original data, 3) Reranking module to enhance scaffold diversity in top recommendations.

Result: Comprehensive computational experiments across five target classes show ScaffAug outperforms baseline methods in multiple evaluation metrics, maintaining and enhancing overall performance while improving scaffold diversity.

Conclusion: ScaffAug introduces novel perspectives on enhancing virtual screening through generative augmentations, reranking, and scaffold-awareness, effectively addressing key challenges in drug discovery.

Abstract: Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery
that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially
bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class
imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active
molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify
structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce
ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through
three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data
conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a
graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore
the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling
algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with
underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used
to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module
with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that
improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of
molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general
performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive
computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug
against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple
evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this
work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging
generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S2-DiGCL is a novel directed graph contrastive learning framework that leverages both complex-domain (via magnetic Laplacian perturbations) and real-domain (via path-based subgraph augmentation) perspectives to capture directional information and spatial dependencies in digraphs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph contrastive learning methods primarily focus on undirected graphs and ignore crucial directional information that is fundamental in real-world networks like social networks and recommendation systems.

Method: S2-DiGCL uses two complementary approaches: 1) Complex-domain perspective with personalized perturbations in magnetic Laplacian to modulate edge phases and directional semantics, and 2) Real-domain perspective with path-based subgraph augmentation to capture local asymmetries and topological dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on 7 real-world digraph datasets show S2-DiGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and 4.34% improvement in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: The proposed S2-DiGCL framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing GCL methods by incorporating directional information through complementary complex and real-domain spatial perspectives, leading to more general and robust digraph representations.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for
extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled
information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected
graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental
and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and
recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that
emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for
directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain
perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic
Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From
the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation
strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological
dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views,
S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more
general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7
real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach,
achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and
4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how memorization combined with composition helps models generalize to rare test examples with unseen combinations of long-tailed features, even in linear settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between memorization and generalization in deep learning, particularly how memorization of long-tailed examples can aid in compositional generalization.

Method: Theoretical analysis in a linear setting and experiments with neural network architectures on simple data to validate the theoretical insights.

Result: Memorization with composition enables correct predictions on rare test examples with unseen combinations of long-tailed features. The composition capability varies with model architecture.

Conclusion: Memorization and composition synergize to enhance generalization, especially for rare examples with novel feature combinations, with architecture playing a key role in composition capability.

Abstract: Deep learning has led researchers to rethink the relationship between
memorization and generalization. In many settings, memorization does not hurt
generalization due to implicit regularization and may help by memorizing
long-tailed examples. In this paper, we consider the synergy between
memorization and simple composition -- the ability to make correct prediction
on a combination of long-tailed features. Theoretically, we show that for a
linear setting, memorization together with composition can help the model make
correct predictions on rare test examples that require a combination of
long-tailed features, even if such combinations were never observed in the
training data. Experiments on neural network architecture on simple data show
that the theoretical insight extends beyond the linear setting, and we further
observe that the composition capability of the model depends on its
architecture.

TL;DR: MGTS-Net is a multimodal graph-enhanced network for time series forecasting that addresses challenges in fine-grained temporal pattern extraction, multimodal integration, and multi-scale feature adaptation through three core components: multimodal feature extraction, fusion via heterogeneous graphs, and multi-scale prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal time series forecasting methods face limitations in extracting fine-grained temporal patterns, optimally integrating multimodal information, and adapting to dynamic multi-scale features, which constrains their accuracy.

Method: MGTS-Net consists of three components: (1) Multimodal Feature Extraction layer that optimizes encoders for temporal, visual, and textual modalities; (2) Multimodal Feature Fusion layer that constructs heterogeneous graphs to model temporal dependencies and cross-modal relationships; (3) Multi-Scale Prediction layer that dynamically weights short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors.

Result: Extensive experiments show MGTS-Net achieves excellent performance with lightweight and high efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed MGTS-Net methodology demonstrates superior performance in multimodal time series forecasting, validating the effectiveness of its graph-enhanced approach for addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating
multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of
such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of
fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal
information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To
address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced
Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core
components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes
feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and
textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a
Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph
to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment
relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a
Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by
dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and
long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits
excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with
other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior
performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.

*Yongxiang Hua,Haoyu Cao,Zhou Tao,Bocheng Li,Zihao Wu,Chaohu Liu,Linli Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Input Domain Aware MoE, a novel routing framework using probabilistic mixture models to better partition input space in sparse Mixture of Experts, achieving improved specialization and balanced utilization compared to conventional similarity-based routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing routing mechanisms in sparse Mixture of Experts struggle to capture input structure effectively, creating a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation that hinders scalability and performance.

Method: Leverages a probabilistic mixture model to partition input space, modeling routing probabilities as mixture distributions to enable clear expert specialization boundaries while maintaining balanced utilization. The routing mechanism is trained independently of task-specific objectives for stable optimization.

Result: Empirical results on vision-language tasks show consistent outperformance of existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task performance and improved expert utilization balance.

Conclusion: The proposed Input Domain Aware MoE framework effectively addresses limitations of conventional routing mechanisms, enabling better input space partitioning and expert specialization while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (sMoE) has become a pivotal approach for scaling
large vision-language models, offering substantial capacity while maintaining
computational efficiency through dynamic, sparse activation of experts.
However, existing routing mechanisms, typically based on similarity scoring,
struggle to effectively capture the underlying input structure. This limitation
leads to a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation,
hindering both scalability and performance. We propose Input Domain Aware MoE,
a novel routing framework that leverages a probabilistic mixture model to
better partition the input space. By modeling routing probabilities as a
mixture of distributions, our method enables experts to develop clear
specialization boundaries while achieving balanced utilization. Unlike
conventional approaches, our routing mechanism is trained independently of
task-specific objectives, allowing for stable optimization and decisive expert
assignments. Empirical results on vision-language tasks demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task
performance and improved expert utilization balance.

*Farwa Abbas,Hussain Ahmad,Claudia Szabo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method using adaptive kernel-based attention to handle high-dimensional heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like PLS struggle with non-linear relationships and high-dimensional correlations in multivariate systems, and static feature weighting lacks adaptability to contextual variations.

Method: Proposes an architecture with adaptive kernel-based attention that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration, capturing both local patterns and global relationships.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in performance metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of traditional approaches by enabling better modeling of complex non-linear relationships and adaptive feature relevance.

Abstract: High-dimensional, heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions pose
significant challenges for traditional predictive modeling approaches. While
Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles
to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems
with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further
compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local
processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static
feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores
sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural
innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention
mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration,
enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships.
Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics,
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

*Alif Elham Khan,Mohammad Junayed Hasan,Humayra Anjum,Nabeel Mohammed,Sifat Momen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning and large language models can predict life satisfaction with high accuracy (93.80% and 93.74% respectively) using Danish government survey data, identifying health condition as the most important determinant across all age groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for measuring life satisfaction are analog, complicated, and error-prone, raising validation concerns. This study aims to leverage AI to create more reliable, reproducible, and interpretable methods for assessing subjective well-being.

Method: Used Danish government survey data of 19,000 people aged 16-64. Applied feature learning to extract 27 significant questions, explored clinical and biomedical LLMs by converting tabular data to natural language sentences, and conducted ablation studies on data resampling and feature selection.

Result: Achieved 93.80% accuracy with machine learning and 93.74% accuracy with LLMs. Biomedical domain performed better than clinical domain for life satisfaction prediction. Health condition was identified as the most important determinant across all age groups.

Conclusion: Machine learning, LLMs, and XAI can jointly build trust in using AI to investigate human behavior, with significant implications for academics and professionals working on subjective well-being quantification and comprehension.

Abstract: Life satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on
life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience
their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health
and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog,
complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions
concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the
potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a
high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a
government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature
learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were
extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily
interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models
(LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular
data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful
counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It
was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the
biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also
conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection
techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary
determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that
health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study
demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly
contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human
behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals
working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being.

*Zitao Fang,Chenxuan Li,Hongting Zhou,Shuyang Yu,Guodong Du,Ashwaq Qasem,Yang Lu,Jing Li,Junsong Zhang,Sim Kuan Goh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeurIPT is a foundation model for EEG-based neural interfaces that uses a pre-trained transformer to handle variability in EEG data through amplitude-aware masking, progressive mixture-of-experts architecture, and spatial electrode coordinate integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG data faces challenges with inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, plus diverse electrode configurations. Current foundation models struggle to generalize across these variations in EEG applications.

Method: Proposes NeurIPT with: 1) Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP) for temporal representation, 2) Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture for diverse temporal characteristics, 3) 3D electrode coordinate embeddings for spatial transfer, and 4) Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) for regional brain feature exploitation.

Result: Evaluated on eight downstream BCI datasets via fine-tuning, NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating broad applicability and robust generalization across diverse EEG settings.

Conclusion: NeurIPT advances foundation models for EEG by providing scalable and generalizable neural information processing, effectively handling the inherent variability in EEG signals and electrode configurations.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical
diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and
variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation
models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early
potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial
inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse
electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open
challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse
EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both
homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG
signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP),
masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust
representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation.
Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive
Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks
are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the
diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages
the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of
embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling
(IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features.
Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning,
demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes
forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and
generalizable neural information processing systems.

### [120] [LANPO: Bootstrapping Language and Numerical Feedback for Reinforcement Learning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16552)
*Ang Li,Yifei Wang,Zhihang Yuan,Stefanie Jegelka,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANPO is a reinforcement learning framework that separates language feedback for exploration from numerical rewards for optimization, using historical experiences to improve sample efficiency in LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL in LLMs uses scalar rewards that discard valuable textual rationale from rollouts, forcing models to explore from scratch each time and reducing sample efficiency. There's a paradox where using feedback from the same problem risks memorization, while different problems cause behavior collapse.

Method: LANPO builds a dynamic experience pool from past trials with two key principles: Reward-Agnostic Reflection for safe intra-sample self-correction and Relevant Abstraction to distill generalizable lessons from inter-sample experiences. It cleanly separates language feedback for exploration from numerical rewards for optimization.

Result: Across mathematical reasoning benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy.

Conclusion: LANPO provides a robust method for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more effective and data-efficient learning agents by resolving the tension between using same-problem and different-problem feedback.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar
rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the
rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and
hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language
feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL
training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information
leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to
behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we
propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a
framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides
exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic
experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure
feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample
self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable
lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong
baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method
for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more
effective and data-efficient learning agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for molecular reasoning using LLMs without labeled data, achieving high success rates in retrosynthesis tasks by anchoring chain-of-thought reasoning to molecular structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the scarcity and expense of labeled data in chemistry applications by enabling LLMs to perform molecular reasoning without requiring labeled training data.

Method: Uses unique atomic identifiers to anchor chain-of-thought reasoning to molecular structure, performing one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and optional few-shot task for chemical transformation prediction.

Result: Achieved high success rates: ‚â•90% for chemically plausible reaction sites, ‚â•40% for named reaction classes, and ‚â•74% for final reactants across academic benchmarks and drug discovery molecules.

Conclusion: The framework enables LLMs to solve complex chemical tasks without labeled data and provides a method to generate synthetic datasets by mapping chemical knowledge onto molecular structures, addressing data scarcity.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the
scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised
methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring
labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the
molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs
a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical
labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this
position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class
examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to
single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed.
Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our
work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically
plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and
final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work
also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by
mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing
data scarcity.

*Tianwei Wang,Xinhui Ma,Wei Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A quaternion-valued supervised learning Hopfield neural network (QSHNN) is proposed, leveraging quaternions' geometric advantages for rotation representation. It extends classic HNNs to quaternionic domain with proven stability and uses periodic projection learning to maintain quaternionic structure while achieving high accuracy and smooth trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing rotations and postures, particularly for applications like robotic arm control and path planning where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons.

Method: Extends continuous-time dynamical model of Hopfield neural networks to quaternionic domain, establishes existence and uniqueness of fixed points with asymptotic stability, and introduces periodic projection strategy that modifies gradient descent by periodically projecting weight matrix blocks onto closest quaternionic structure.

Result: Experimental implementation achieves high accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated target sets. Evolution trajectories exhibit well-bounded curvature and sufficient smoothness, crucial for control systems and robotic applications.

Conclusion: The proposed QSHNN offers both a practical implementation framework and general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures, with demonstrated advantages for applications requiring smooth rotational representations.

Abstract: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing
rotations and postures, we propose a quaternion-valued supervised learning
Hopfield-structured neural network (QSHNN) with a fully connected structure
inspired by the classic Hopfield neural network (HNN). Starting from a
continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the
quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points
with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic
projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically
projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic
structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence
and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous
mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high
accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated
target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit
well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for
applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms,
where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these
application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation
framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks
under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures.

*Avrim Blum,Daniel Hsu,Cyrus Rashtchian,Donya Saless*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes test-time augmentation in AI models, framing multi-step reasoning as a graph connectivity problem. It shows a phase transition: when prior knowledge is fragmented, augmentation requires many queries, but once a critical density threshold is reached, paths can be found with constant queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical relationship between a model's parametric knowledge and external augmentation, specifically determining how much pre-training knowledge is needed for efficient query answering with limited augmentation steps.

Method: Formulates multi-step reasoning as an s-t connectivity problem on knowledge graphs, representing pre-training knowledge as a partial/noisy subgraph and augmentation as querying an oracle for true edges. Uses graph theory to characterize necessary augmentation steps.

Result: Shows a phase transition: when prior knowledge graph is disconnected into small components, Œ©(‚àön) queries are needed, but once density surpasses a threshold forming a giant component, paths can be found with constant expected queries.

Conclusion: There exists a critical density threshold for prior knowledge where augmentation efficiency dramatically improves, transitioning from requiring many queries to constant queries once a giant component forms in the knowledge graph.

Abstract: Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool
use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge
and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of
this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how
much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number
of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address
this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity
problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric
knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as
querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we
characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the
model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key
result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices
is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is
inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once
the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant
component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.

*Noah El Rimawi-Fine,Adam Stecklov,Lucas Nelson,Mathieu Blanchette,Alexander Tong,Stephen Y. Zhang,Lazar Atanackovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StructureFlow is a simulation-free method that jointly learns network structure and stochastic population dynamics from partial, noisy measurements of high-dimensional physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many physical systems like those in cell biology are high-dimensional, stochastic, and only partially observable, making it challenging to model dynamics and infer causal relationships simultaneously. Existing methods focus on either structure learning or population-level dynamics modeling, but not both.

Method: StructureFlow is a principled simulation-free approach that jointly learns the structure and stochastic population dynamics. It handles structure learning from interventions and dynamical inference of conditional population dynamics.

Result: The method was evaluated on high-dimensional synthetic systems, biologically plausible simulated systems, and experimental single-cell data. It successfully learned underlying system structures while modeling conditional population dynamics.

Conclusion: StructureFlow enables simultaneous structure learning and dynamical modeling, representing a key step toward mechanistic understanding of complex system behaviors in domains like cell biology.

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal
relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various
physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently
high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state
measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of
modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these
systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning
or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability
to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems
simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled
simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic
population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of
StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and
dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We
empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set
of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell
dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying
systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics --
a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.

*Azam Shirali,Giri Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PUMBA improves protein-protein docking accuracy by replacing Vision Transformers with Vision Mamba in the PIsToN scoring function, achieving better performance through enhanced global and local pattern capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current docking tools need robust scoring functions to differentiate native from non-native protein complexes. Vision Mamba has shown superior performance over Transformers in other domains, suggesting potential improvements for protein-protein interface evaluation.

Method: Replaced the Vision Transformer backbone in PIsToN with Vision Mamba architecture, leveraging Mamba's efficient long-range sequence modeling for image patches to better capture global and local patterns in protein-protein interfaces.

Result: PUMBA consistently outperforms the original PIsToN model across multiple large-scale public datasets, demonstrating improved scoring accuracy for protein-protein complexes.

Conclusion: Vision Mamba architecture successfully enhances protein-protein interface evaluation, providing a more effective alternative to Transformer-based approaches for docking scoring functions.

Abstract: Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins,
and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the
accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can
reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a
state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision
Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has
demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and
computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains.
In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with
Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer
backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient
long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the
model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein
interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several
widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently
outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel active target discovery framework that works effectively even with uninformative priors, overcoming limitations of generative models in data-scarce domains through interpretable, theoretically principled design inspired by neuroscience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of active target discovery in domains where learning strong priors is infeasible due to limited data or high sampling costs (e.g., rare species discovery, emerging disease diagnostics), where existing generative model-based methods struggle to generalize.

Method: Proposes a theoretically principled framework inspired by neuroscience that enables effective active target discovery with uninformative priors. The approach is interpretable (unlike black-box policies) and guarantees monotonic improvement in prior estimates with each new observation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across various domains including species distribution modeling and remote sensing demonstrate that the method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust exploration and adaptability in complex real-world scenarios with limited data, ensuring reliable and increasingly accurate sampling through monotonic improvement in prior estimates.

Abstract: In many scientific and engineering fields, where acquiring high-quality data
is expensive--such as medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote
sensing--strategic sampling of unobserved regions based on prior observations
is crucial for maximizing discovery rates within a constrained budget. The rise
of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active
target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned
priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from
data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations,
these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct
queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong
prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such
as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these
methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel
approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with
uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex
real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws
inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies,
our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into
decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in
prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate
sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings.
Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains,
including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that
our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.

TL;DR: A compact benchmark for streaming clinical time series on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database comparing GRU-D (RNN) and Transformer models for tachycardia risk prediction and heart rate forecasting under matched training budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time series analysis and compare the performance of compact RNNs and Transformers in longitudinal monitoring tasks.

Method: Used per-second heart rate data from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database with record-level, non-overlapping splits. Evaluated two tasks: near-term tachycardia risk (next 10 seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. Compared GRU-D and Transformer models against strong non-learned baselines with matched training budgets.

Result: On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly outperformed Transformer for tachycardia risk prediction, while Transformer clearly reduced forecasting error compared to both GRU-D and persistence baseline.

Conclusion: Model choice in longitudinal monitoring is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, while compact Transformers provide clearer advantages for point forecasting tasks.

Abstract: We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time
series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two
tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term
tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We
compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against
strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for
classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped
bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the
Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers
forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in
longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain
competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers
deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for privacy-preserving machine learning using a diffusion approach, providing exact behavior analysis in high dimensions and studying a variant that doesn't require gradient sensitivity knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work provides bounds on statistical risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, but the exact behavior remains unclear, especially in high-dimensional settings. There's a need to understand the precise dynamics of privacy-preserving optimization algorithms.

Method: The paper uses a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD, providing a continuous-time perspective that captures statistical risk evolution and privacy loss dynamics. It focuses on least squares problems with ‚Ñì2 regularization and studies a variant that doesn't require explicit knowledge of gradient sensitivity.

Result: The diffusion approach enables precise analysis of noisy SGD behavior in high dimensions, capturing both statistical risk evolution and privacy loss dynamics. The method provides insights into the exact behavior of privacy-preserving optimization processes.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based analysis offers a comprehensive framework for understanding noisy SGD in privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly addressing the gap in exact behavior analysis in high-dimensional settings and providing an alternative approach that eliminates the need for gradient sensitivity knowledge.

Abstract: The interplay between optimization and privacy has become a central theme in
privacy-preserving machine learning. Noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm, particularly in large-scale settings.
These variants of gradient methods inject carefully calibrated noise into each
update to achieve differential privacy, the gold standard notion of rigorous
privacy guarantees. Prior work primarily provides various bounds on statistical
risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, yet the \textit{exact} behavior of the
process remains unclear, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work
leverages a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD precisely, providing a
continuous-time perspective that captures both statistical risk evolution and
privacy loss dynamics in high dimensions. Moreover, we study a variant of noisy
SGD that does not require explicit knowledge of gradient sensitivity, unlike
existing work that assumes or enforces sensitivity through gradient clipping.
Specifically, we focus on the least squares problem with $\ell_2$
regularization.

Motivation: Secure federated learning preserves data privacy but faces performance bottlenecks from straggler clients with limited computational or network capabilities, which slow down training for all participants.

Method: Proposes CLIP, a client-side invariant neuron pruning technique combined with network-aware pruning to address compute and network bottlenecks caused by stragglers during training.

Result: Accelerates secure FL training by 13% to 34% across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, Shakespeare, FEMNIST) with accuracy impact ranging from 1.3% improvement to 2.6% reduction.

Conclusion: CLIP effectively mitigates straggler bottlenecks in secure federated learning while maintaining model accuracy, demonstrating practical viability for heterogeneous device deployments.

Abstract: Secure federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy during distributed
model training. However, deploying such frameworks across heterogeneous devices
results in performance bottlenecks, due to straggler clients with limited
computational or network capabilities, slowing training for all participating
clients. This paper introduces the first straggler mitigation technique for
secure aggregation with deep neural networks. We propose CLIP, a client-side
invariant neuron pruning technique coupled with network-aware pruning, that
addresses compute and network bottlenecks due to stragglers during training
with minimal accuracy loss. Our technique accelerates secure FL training by 13%
to 34% across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, Shakespeare, FEMNIST) with an
accuracy impact of between 1.3% improvement to 2.6% reduction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting methods struggle with zero-shot forecasting where predictions are needed for conditions without direct historical data, particularly in microclimate modeling where spatial correlations and temporal patterns are crucial.

Method: Decomposes signals into different frequency components and employs resolution-aware retrieval - lower-frequency components use broader spatial context while higher-frequency components focus on local influences, enabling dynamic data retrieval and adaptation to new locations.

Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by
leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By
decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs
resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader
spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences.
This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new
locations with minimal historical context.
  Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms
traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and
modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34%
lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset.
  Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and
resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution
for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for reliable EV charging demand forecasting to support infrastructure planning, energy management, and grid integration of charging facilities.

Method: Processes raw EV charging data from multiple locations using interpolation for missing values, normalization, and feature extraction, then trains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.

Result: Experimental results show the model accurately predicts charging demand across multiple time scales (daily, weekly, monthly) and can adapt to different charging locations with varying usage patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed LSTM-based framework provides an effective solution for EV charging load forecasting that is modular, adaptable to diverse deployment scenarios, and valuable for infrastructure planning and grid management.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for processing EV charging load data in order
to forecast future load predictions using a Recurrent Neural Network,
specifically an LSTM. The framework processes a large set of raw data from
multiple locations and transforms it with normalization and feature extraction
to train the LSTM. The pre-processing stage corrects for missing or incomplete
values by interpolating and normalizing the measurements. This information is
then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory Model designed to capture the short-term
fluctuations while also interpreting the long-term trends in the charging data.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict
charging demand across multiple time scales (daily, weekly, and monthly),
providing valuable insights for infrastructure planning, energy management, and
grid integration of EV charging facilities. The system's modular design allows
for adaptation to different charging locations with varying usage patterns,
making it applicable across diverse deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper presents a multitask learning approach using latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes to predict learning curves for NLP models, enabling probabilistic scaling laws and active learning for reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable informed decision-making for NLP model development by predicting learning curves, reducing computational overhead and costs associated with dataset acquisition and curation.

Method: Formulates learning curve prediction as a multitask learning problem with two-layer hierarchical data organization, using latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes to model task correlations and support zero-shot prediction.

Result: The approach facilitates development of probabilistic scaling laws at lower costs, with active learning reducing predictive uncertainty and providing predictions close to ground truth scaling laws. Validated on three NLP datasets with up to 30 learning curves from various models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully predicts learning curves for NLP models using multitask Gaussian Processes, enabling cost-effective development of probabilistic scaling laws through active learning strategies.

Abstract: The prediction of learning curves for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models enables informed decision-making to meet specific performance
objectives, while reducing computational overhead and lowering the costs
associated with dataset acquisition and curation. In this work, we formulate
the prediction task as a multitask learning problem, where each task's data is
modelled as being organized within a two-layer hierarchy. To model the shared
information and dependencies across tasks and hierarchical levels, we employ
latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes, enabling to account for task
correlations and supporting zero-shot prediction of learning curves (LCs). We
demonstrate that this approach facilitates the development of probabilistic
scaling laws at lower costs. Applying an active learning strategy, LCs can be
queried to reduce predictive uncertainty and provide predictions close to
ground truth scaling laws. We validate our framework on three small-scale NLP
datasets with up to $30$ LCs. These are obtained from nanoGPT models, from
bilingual translation using mBART and Transformer models, and from multilingual
translation using M2M100 models of varying sizes.

### [133] [An Efficient Semantic Segmentation Decoder for In-Car or Distributed Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16747)
*Danish Nazir,Gowtham Sai Inti,Timo Bartels,Jan Piewek,Thorsten Bagdonat,Tim Fingscheidt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed joint feature and task decoding for SegDeformer transformer model to reduce computational complexity in automotive semantic segmentation applications, achieving significant speed improvements for in-car use and state-of-the-art performance with minimal cloud parameters for distributed applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern automotive systems use DNNs for semantic segmentation in two scenarios: in-car (no data rate constraints) and distributed (vehicle-cloud with bitrate constraints). Prior work used CNNs but didn't explore transformer alternatives like SegDeformer, which offer better performance but higher computational complexity.

Method: Proposed joint feature and task decoding for SegDeformer transformer model, enabling lower computational complexity in both in-car and distributed automotive applications despite SegDeformer's inherent computational demands.

Result: For in-car: Increased fps by up to 11.7x (1.4 to 16.5 fps) on Cityscapes and 3.5x (43.3 to 154.3 fps) on ADE20K while maintaining comparable mIoU. For distributed: Achieved SOTA mIoU across bitrates using only 0.14% (ADE20K) and 0.04% (Cityscapes) of cloud DNN parameters compared to previous SOTA.

Conclusion: The proposed joint decoding approach successfully enables transformer-based SegDeformer for automotive semantic segmentation, significantly improving computational efficiency for both in-car and distributed applications while maintaining competitive performance metrics.

Abstract: Modern automotive systems leverage deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic
segmentation and operate in two key application areas: (1) In-car, where the
DNN solely operates in the vehicle without strict constraints on the data rate.
(2) Distributed, where one DNN part operates in the vehicle and the other part
typically on a large-scale cloud platform with a particular constraint on
transmission bitrate efficiency. Typically, both applications share an image
and source encoder, while each uses distinct (joint) source and task decoders.
Prior work utilized convolutional neural networks for joint source and task
decoding but did not investigate transformer-based alternatives such as
SegDeformer, which offer superior performance at the cost of higher
computational complexity. In this work, we propose joint feature and task
decoding for SegDeformer, thereby enabling lower computational complexity in
both in-car and distributed applications, despite SegDeformer's computational
demands. This improves scalability in the cloud while reducing in-car
computational complexity. For the in-car application, we increased the frames
per second (fps) by up to a factor of $11.7$ ($1.4$ fps to $16.5$ fps) on
Cityscapes and by up to a factor of $3.5$ ($43.3$ fps to $154.3$ fps) on
ADE20K, while being on-par w.r.t.\ the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of
the transformer-based baseline that doesn't compress by a source codec. For the
distributed application, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) over a wide range
of bitrates on the mIoU metric, while using only $0.14$\% ($0.04$\%) of cloud
DNN parameters used in previous SOTA, reported on ADE20K (Cityscapes).

*Young In Kim,Andrea Agiollo,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMOSA is a novel open set active learning method that uses sharpness-aware minimization to query atypical samples near decision boundaries, achieving 3% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods without computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the costly burden of data labeling in machine learning by developing an effective open set active learning approach that can select informative samples from unlabeled data containing irrelevant or unknown classes.

Method: Proposes SAMOSA (Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning) that actively queries samples based on their typicality, identifying atypical samples near model decision boundaries using theoretical findings about SGD and SAM generalization properties.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods across several datasets, while maintaining computational efficiency with no additional overhead.

Conclusion: SAMOSA effectively identifies and prioritizes informative samples that are both useful for targeted classes and for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes, providing a practical solution for open set active learning problems.

Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where
labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning
approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled
data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose
Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an
effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the
impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM),
SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively
identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold
close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the
samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii)
useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive
experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the
state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational
overhead. The source code of our experiments is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for training AI agents to play 3D first-person video games using behavior cloning with text instructions, using a large dataset of human gameplay and an inverse dynamics model to impute actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D first-person video games present a challenging environment for real-time multi-modal reasoning, requiring the combination of visual perception, action planning, and text instruction following.

Method: Collected a large diverse dataset of human gameplay with text instructions, learned an inverse dynamics model to impute actions on public videos, and trained a text-conditioned agent using behavior cloning with a custom real-time inference architecture.

Result: The resulting model can play various 3D games and respond to text input, demonstrating capabilities in real-time game playing with instruction following.

Conclusion: While successful in creating playable agents, challenges remain in long-horizon tasks and quantitative evaluation across multiple games, indicating areas for future improvement.

Abstract: We argue that 3-D first-person video games are a challenging environment for
real-time multi-modal reasoning. We first describe our dataset of human
game-play, collected across a large variety of 3-D first-person games, which is
both substantially larger and more diverse compared to prior publicly disclosed
datasets, and contains text instructions. We demonstrate that we can learn an
inverse dynamics model from this dataset, which allows us to impute actions on
a much larger dataset of publicly available videos of human game play that lack
recorded actions. We then train a text-conditioned agent for game playing using
behavior cloning, with a custom architecture capable of realtime inference on a
consumer GPU. We show the resulting model is capable of playing a variety of
3-D games and responding to text input. Finally, we outline some of the
remaining challenges such as long-horizon tasks and quantitative evaluation
across a large set of games.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 3D-GSRD is a novel molecular representation learning method that addresses challenges in 3D masked graph modeling by using selective re-mask decoding to prevent 2D structure leakage while maintaining sufficient 2D context for reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending masked graph modeling from 2D to 3D molecular representation learning is challenging due to conflicting requirements: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder while providing enough 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms.

Method: Proposes 3D-GSRD with Selective Re-mask Decoding (SRD) that re-masks only 3D-relevant information while preserving 2D graph structures, combined with a 3D Relational-Transformer encoder and structure-independent decoder.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 out of 8 targets in the MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark, demonstrating strong downstream performance.

Conclusion: 3D-GSRD's selective re-mask decoding approach effectively enhances molecular representation learning by balancing 3D information processing with 2D context preservation, setting new benchmarks in molecular property prediction.

Abstract: Masked graph modeling (MGM) is a promising approach for molecular
representation learning (MRL).However, extending the success of re-mask
decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting
challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing
sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms.To address these
challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with
Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its
Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information
from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures.This SRD
is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans)
encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD,
combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in
MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream
performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely
used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark. The code is released at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision Quantization frameworks for Large Language Models (MXPLMs), covering quantization fundamentals, bit allocation strategies, performance comparisons, and future research directions to balance efficiency and accuracy in model deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid scaling of language models has resulted in unsustainable computational, memory, and energy requirements, making quantization essential for reducing model size and accelerating inference while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The survey categorizes and compares recent MXPLM frameworks based on their bit allocation strategies and precision configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches, while contrasting them with earlier mixed-precision methods for deep neural networks.

Result: The analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and deployment trade-offs among various mixed-precision quantization approaches, identifying strategies that transfer well and those that face challenges in the LM setting.

Conclusion: The work consolidates recent advances in mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models and identifies open research directions including hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization methods for billion-parameter models.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented
computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and
deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential
compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and
accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8,
INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in
sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization
offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across
layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks
for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform
and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used
in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM
frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision
configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative
analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and
deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier
mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying
strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting.
Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including
hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization
methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this
work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research
prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

### [138] [Computational Budget Should Be Considered in Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16806)
*Weilin Wan,Weizhong Zhang,Cheng Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CADS introduces a compute budget-aware data selection method using bilevel optimization, addressing computational efficiency challenges through probabilistic reparameterization and Hessian-free gradient estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection methods ignore compute budget constraints, leading to inconsistent performance across different budgets. Different budgets require distinct data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training.

Method: Proposed CADS uses bilevel optimization: inner loop trains model within compute budget on selected data subset, outer loop optimizes data selection based on model evaluation. Uses probabilistic reparameterization and Hessian-free policy gradient for gradient estimation, and transforms inner optimization into penalty term.

Result: Achieves performance gains up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency and model performance.

Conclusion: Compute budget must be integral to data selection strategies, and CADS effectively addresses this by formulating budget-aware selection as bilevel optimization with efficient gradient estimation techniques.

Abstract: Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative
subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute
budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of
compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can
consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying
budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to
data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements
on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this
end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method
and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the
inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget
on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data
selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in
addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem:
the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the
computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To
solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy
and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To
address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into
a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to
estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient,
significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and
language benchmarks.

*Zhoutong Wu,Yuan Zhang,Yiming Dong,Chenheng Zhang,Cong Fang,Kun Yuan,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SkipV1Former is a Transformer variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to reduce KV cache by ~25% while improving perplexity, and can be uptrained from existing models with minimal compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Transformer representation without increasing resource usage, addressing the high memory and compute costs of KV cache in auto-regressive decoding while maintaining strong performance.

Method: From the second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very first layer while computing the other half normally, reducing Value projections and V cache by nearly 50%.

Result: Consistent ~25% reduction in KV cache across different model scales while improving perplexity compared to standard MHA Transformers and advanced variants.

Conclusion: SkipV1Former effectively strengthens model representation and reduces KV cache, can be uptrained from existing models with only 10-15% additional compute, and combines well with other advanced attention methods for further improvements.

Abstract: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by
their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them
to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and
compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive
decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation
without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve
expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of
weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer
variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to
strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the
second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very
first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections
and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed
first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression
and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of
Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model
scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in
KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention
(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe
for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only
10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine
advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to
achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined
with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving
performance.

*Mohammad Shahverdikondori,Jalal Etesami,Negar Kiyavash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that learning the parent set in causal bandits is suboptimal for regret minimization, proving that regret minimization and parent identification can be conflicting objectives. The authors establish novel regret lower bounds and propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass graph recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work on causal bandits focused on identifying the reward's parents and applying classic bandit methods, or jointly learning parents while minimizing regret. The authors investigate whether these strategies are optimal.

Method: The authors prove that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. They analyze both known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret lower bounds, and propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass graph and parent recovery.

Result: The results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal for regret minimization. Experiments confirm a large performance gap between the proposed method and existing baselines in various environments.

Conclusion: Parent identification is unnecessary for regret minimization in causal bandits. The proposed algorithms that bypass graph recovery achieve nearly optimal performance without needing to learn the causal structure.

Abstract: We study regret minimization in causal bandits under causal sufficiency where
the underlying causal structure is not known to the agent. Previous work has
focused on identifying the reward's parents and then applying classic bandit
methods to them, or jointly learning the parents while minimizing regret. We
investigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively,
our results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by
proving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent
identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze
both the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret
lower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space.
Building on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass
graph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed
unnecessary for regret minimization. Experiments confirm that there exists a
large performance gap between our method and existing baselines in various
environments.

*Simon Jaxy,Anton Theys,Patrick Willett,W. Chris Carleton,Ralf Vandam,Pieter Libin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a semi-supervised deep learning approach for archaeological predictive modeling that addresses structural label scarcity by using positive-unlabeled learning with dynamic pseudolabeling and CRF refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of structural label scarcity in archaeology where positive site locations are rare and most locations are unlabeled, requiring methods that can work with limited labeled data.

Method: Uses semi-supervised positive-unlabeled learning implemented as semantic segmentation with dynamic pseudolabeling refined by Conditional Random Field (CRF) via RNN to handle severe class imbalance.

Result: The model performs on par with state-of-the-art LAMAP on geospatial DEM data while achieving higher Dice scores, and maintains performance on raw satellite imagery with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised learning offers a promising approach for identifying undiscovered archaeological sites across large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

Abstract: Archaeological predictive modelling estimates where undiscovered sites are
likely to occur by combining known locations with environmental, cultural, and
geospatial variables. We address this challenge using a deep learning approach
but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology:
positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt
a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a
semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a
representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic
pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via
an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a
geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model
performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice
scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold
cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with
improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised
learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across
large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANO is a novel neural operator that uses agent tokens to achieve linear complexity while maintaining softmax attention's accuracy, outperforming current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers by 19.5% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scalability-accuracy trade-off in transformer-based neural operators where softmax attention has quadratic complexity and linear attention variants suffer accuracy degradation.

Method: Introduces agent-based attention mechanism with a compact set of M agent tokens (M << N) that mediate global interactions among N tokens, achieving linear complexity O(MNd) while preserving softmax attention's expressive power.

Result: LANO surpasses current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers including Transolver, achieving 19.5% average accuracy improvement across standard benchmarks while maintaining linear complexity.

Conclusion: LANO bridges the gap between linear complexity and softmax-level performance, establishing a scalable, high-accuracy foundation for scientific machine learning applications.

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful data-driven framework for learning mappings
between function spaces, in which the transformer-based neural operator
architecture faces a fundamental scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax
attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity
$\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$,
while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often
suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned
challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear
Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high
accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO
resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll
N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention
mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$
while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we
demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating
improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses
current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with
slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement
across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and
softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy
foundation for scientific machine learning applications.

*Doyoon Kim,Junbin Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRPINN is an enhanced physics-informed neural network that enforces boundary loss using the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm H^{1/2}(‚àÇŒ©), improving convergence and computational efficiency compared to standard PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs have limitations in handling boundary conditions effectively, especially for problems with highly oscillatory boundary conditions. The motivation is to develop a more theoretically sound and computationally efficient approach by using the correct trace space associated with H^1(Œ©).

Method: The method involves computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm to reduce computational cost, avoiding denominator evaluations in discretization to enhance convergence stability, and incorporating the exact H^{1/2}(‚àÇŒ©) norm for boundary loss enforcement.

Result: Numerical experiments on Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary conditions show that TRPINN succeeds where standard PINNs fail, achieving performance improvements of one to three decimal digits. NTK analysis demonstrates faster convergence than standard PINNs.

Conclusion: TRPINN provides a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient enhancement to PINNs, ensuring convergence to the true solution in the H^1(Œ©) sense and demonstrating superior performance for problems with challenging boundary conditions.

Abstract: We propose an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN), the Trace
Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN), which enforces the
boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, the
correct trace space associated with $H^1(\Omega)$. We reduce computational cost
by computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm and
enhance convergence stability by avoiding denominator evaluations in the
discretization. By incorporating the exact $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm, we
show that the approximation converges to the true solution in the
$H^{1}(\Omega)$ sense, and, through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we
demonstrate that TRPINN can converge faster than standard PINNs. Numerical
experiments on the Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary
conditions exhibit cases where TRPINN succeeds even when standard PINNs fail,
and show performance improvements of one to three decimal digits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces bilinear autoencoders to decompose neural network representations into quadratic polynomials, enabling algebraic analysis without input dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sparse autoencoders have interpretation limitations due to input dependency, while polynomials provide algebraic primitives that can be analyzed independently of inputs and describe complex structures.

Method: Uses bilinear autoencoders to efficiently decompose representations into quadratic polynomials, with improvements for importance ordering, clustering, and activation sparsity.

Result: Developed a method for nonlinear yet analyzable latent representations through their algebraic properties, providing an initial framework for interpretable decomposition.

Conclusion: This work represents an initial step toward creating nonlinear latent representations that remain analyzable through algebraic properties, addressing limitations of input-dependent interpretation in traditional autoencoders.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a standard tool for uncovering interpretable latent
representations in neural networks. Yet, their interpretation depends on the
inputs, making their isolated study incomplete. Polynomials offer a solution;
they serve as algebraic primitives that can be analysed without reference to
input and can describe structures ranging from linear concepts to complicated
manifolds. This work uses bilinear autoencoders to efficiently decompose
representations into quadratic polynomials. We discuss improvements that induce
importance ordering, clustering, and activation sparsity. This is an initial
step toward nonlinear yet analysable latents through their algebraic
properties.

### [145] [ProtoMol: Enhancing Molecular Property Prediction via Prototype-Guided Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16824)
*Yingxu Wang,Kunyu Zhang,Jiaxin Huang,Nan Yin,Siwei Liu,Eran Segal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoMol is a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and textual descriptions through hierarchical encoders, layer-wise bidirectional cross-modal attention, and a shared prototype space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal molecular representation learning methods suffer from limited cross-modal interaction (only at final encoder layer) and lack unified prototype space for robust alignment between modalities, which hinders hierarchical semantic dependencies and consistent semantic alignment.

Method: ProtoMol uses dual-branch hierarchical encoders (Graph Neural Networks for molecular graphs and Transformers for texts), layer-wise bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism, and constructs a shared prototype space with learnable, class-specific anchors to guide both modalities toward coherent representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various molecular property prediction tasks.

Conclusion: ProtoMol effectively addresses limitations of existing multimodal methods by enabling fine-grained integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and textual descriptions, achieving superior performance in molecular property prediction.

Abstract: Multimodal molecular representation learning, which jointly models molecular
graphs and their textual descriptions, enhances predictive accuracy and
interpretability by enabling more robust and reliable predictions of drug
toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties through the integration
of structural and semantic information. However, existing multimodal methods
suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal
interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical
semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust
alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained
integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and
textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders,
utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and
Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive
layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise
bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns
semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with
learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities
toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction
tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive
electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle
range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable
trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that
sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers
transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations --
inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors
exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present
DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations
generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset
systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided
Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including
complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal
airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a
five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies
with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on
this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs
from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic
machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new
standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development.
Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for

*Heming Zou,Yunliang Zang,Wutong Xu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fly-CL is a bio-inspired framework for continual representation learning that addresses multicollinearity in similarity-matching while reducing training time, achieving performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning while overcoming multicollinearity issues in similarity-matching and computational limitations of advanced methods for real-time applications.

Method: Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, Fly-CL uses a bio-inspired framework compatible with various pretrained backbones, progressively resolving multicollinearity through biologically inspired design.

Result: Fly-CL substantially reduces training time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding current state-of-the-art methods across diverse network architectures and data regimes.

Conclusion: The biologically inspired Fly-CL framework effectively addresses multicollinearity in continual representation learning with low time complexity, validated through extensive simulations.

Abstract: Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning
paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained
features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the
similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally
prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly
olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with
a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training
time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current
state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively
resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with
low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network
architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing
this challenge through a biologically inspired design. Code is available at

### [148] [Utility-Diversity Aware Online Batch Selection for LLM Supervised Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16882)
*Heming Zou,Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Qi Wang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UDS (Utility-Diversity Sampling) is an efficient online batch selection framework for supervised fine-tuning that balances data utility and diversity without external resources, reducing training time while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online batch selection methods for SFT often focus only on data utility while neglecting diversity, require external resources like reference models or validation sets, and incur extra training time compared to full-dataset training.

Method: UDS uses nuclear norm of logits matrix to capture data utility and intra-sample diversity, and estimates inter-sample diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a lightweight memory buffer of historical samples, eliminating need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation.

Result: Experiments show UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods under varying data budgets and significantly reduces training time compared to full-dataset fine-tuning.

Conclusion: UDS provides an efficient and effective framework for online batch selection in SFT that addresses key limitations of existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large
language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset
is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias
amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which
prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online
batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the
training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on
the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors
like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or
validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset
training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS
(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection
in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both
data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample
diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a
lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the
need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing
computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods
under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to
full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

### [149] [UniGTE: Unified Graph-Text Encoding for Zero-Shot Generalization across Graph Tasks and Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16885)
*Duo Wang,Yuan Zuo,Guangyue Lu,Junjie Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniGTE is an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework that unifies structural and semantic reasoning for graph tasks, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on various graph tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional graph neural networks (fixed label space) and large language models (struggle with graph structure) in generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision.

Method: An encoder-decoder framework where the encoder augments a pretrained LLM with learnable alignment tokens and structure-aware graph-text attention, while a frozen LLM decoder predicts answers and reconstructs input graphs through natural language paraphrasing.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression under cross-task and cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: Tight integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable graph reasoning, demonstrating that UniGTE can effectively generalize across diverse graph tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is
challenging: conventional graph neural networks are typically tied to a fixed
label space, while large language models (LLMs) struggle to capture graph
structure. We introduce UniGTE, an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework
that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a
pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a
structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly
to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining
permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph
representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen LLM
decoder predicts and reconstructs: it outputs the task answer and
simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The
reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues.
UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level,
and graph-level tasks across diverse domains, yet requires no fine-tuning at
inference. It achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node
classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression
under cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating that tight
integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable
graph reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SE(3)-equivariant neural network libraries require substantial deep learning or mathematical knowledge and lack complete training pipelines, making them inaccessible to many scientists working on molecular applications.

Method: Extend DeepChem with support for ready-to-use equivariant models including SE(3)-Transformer and Tensor Field Networks, providing complete training pipelines, equivariant utilities, comprehensive tests, and documentation.

Result: Created an implementation that enables scientists with minimal deep learning background to build, train, and evaluate SE(3)-equivariant models for molecular applications.

Conclusion: The DeepChem extension facilitates both application and further development of SE(3)-equivariant models by providing accessible, well-documented tools that lower the barrier to entry for scientific users.

Abstract: Neural networks that incorporate geometric relationships respecting SE(3)
group transformations (e.g. rotations and translations) are increasingly
important in molecular applications, such as molecular property prediction,
protein structure modeling, and materials design. These models, known as
SE(3)-equivariant neural networks, ensure outputs transform predictably with
input coordinate changes by explicitly encoding spatial atomic positions.
Although libraries such as E3NN [4] and SE(3)-TRANSFORMER [3 ] offer powerful
implementations, they often require substantial deep learning or mathematical
prior knowledge and lack complete training pipelines. We extend DEEPCHEM [ 13]
with support for ready-to-use equivariant models, enabling scientists with
minimal deep learning background to build, train, and evaluate models, such as
SE(3)-Transformer and Tensor Field Networks. Our implementation includes
equivariant models, complete training pipelines, and a toolkit of equivariant
utilities, supported with comprehensive tests and documentation, to facilitate
both application and further development of SE(3)-equivariant models.

*Sarah Al-Shareeda,Gulcihan Ozdemir,Heung Seok Jeon,Khaleel Ahmad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight DL pipeline combining preprocessing techniques and GRU-LSTM model achieves accurate next-day energy consumption forecasting with 84.36% accuracy despite noisy, incomplete sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurate short-term energy forecasting using noisy, incomplete sensor data lacking contextual richness, as presented in the 2025 Competition on Electric Energy Consumption Forecast.

Method: Proposed a robust DL pipeline with hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial regression), comprehensive normalization (Standard Scaling selected), and a lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model.

Result: Achieved average RMSE of 601.9W, MAE of 468.9W, and 84.36% accuracy. Model generalized well despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, captured nonlinear patterns, maintained low latency, and showed strong temperature-consumption correlation.

Conclusion: Targeted preprocessing paired with compact recurrent architectures enables fast, accurate, and deployment-ready energy forecasting in real-world conditions.

Abstract: How can short-term energy consumption be accurately forecasted when sensor
data is noisy, incomplete, and lacks contextual richness? This question guided
our participation in the \textit{2025 Competition on Electric Energy
Consumption Forecast Adopting Multi-criteria Performance Metrics}, which
challenged teams to predict next-day power demand using real-world
high-frequency data. We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL)
pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial
regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard
Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model
achieves an average RMSE of 601.9~W, MAE of 468.9~W, and 84.36\% accuracy.
Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured
nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably,
spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature
trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability.
These results demonstrate that targeted preprocessing paired with compact
recurrent architectures can still enable fast, accurate, and deployment-ready
energy forecasting in real-world conditions.

### [152] [Domain Generalizable Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16914)
*Hongwei Yan,Guanglong Sun,Zhiqi Kang,Yi Zhong,Liyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Domain Generalizable Continual Learning (DGCL), a challenging setting where models learn sequential tasks from single domains and must generalize across all encountered domains. The authors propose Adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), a plug-in method that disentangles semantic and domain information using brain-inspired principles to enable robust generalization in DGCL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods assume identical training and testing domains per task, failing in real-world scenarios where models must generalize to unseen domains while learning sequentially. The DGCL setting addresses this gap by requiring models to perform well across all encountered domains.

Method: Proposed Adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human brain. DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in representation learning and adaptively transforms task representations across domains for output alignment.

Result: DoT significantly enhances state-of-the-art continual learning baselines in DGCL under both full parameter tuning and parameter-efficient tuning. It enables models to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge and maintains resource efficiency with lightweight implementation.

Conclusion: DoT effectively addresses the unique challenges of DGCL by disentangling semantic and domain information, enabling robust generalization across sequential tasks and domains while being computationally efficient and easily integrable with existing CL methods.

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems
must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen
scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain
generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with
each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered
tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,
retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for
robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)
methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific
generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains
for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose
adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach
tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human
brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in
representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across
various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized
predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates
state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and
parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive
experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge
from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolverLLM is a training-free framework that uses test-time scaling and Monte Carlo Tree Search to solve optimization problems by generating mathematical formulations and converting them to solver code, outperforming existing methods without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for optimization problems either rely on prompt engineering with poor generalization or require costly supervised training, creating a need for a more flexible and efficient solution.

Method: SolverLLM generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code using a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search strategy with dynamic expansion, prompt backpropagation, and uncertainty backpropagation.

Result: Experiments on six standard benchmark datasets show SolverLLM outperforms both prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization without additional training.

Conclusion: SolverLLM provides an effective training-free framework for solving diverse optimization problems through test-time scaling and enhanced MCTS, demonstrating superior performance and generalization compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling
complex reasoning tasks, including optimization problems. However, existing
methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization
across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce
SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve
diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM
generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code,
guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the
search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for
adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide
exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to
incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both
prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization
without additional training.

Result: Complete Hessian characterization of full Transformer blocks, estimations for sublayer roles in curvature propagation, and insights into convergence dynamics and empirical scaling laws.

Conclusion: Establishes a new foundation for theoretical and empirical investigations of optimization in large-scale deep learning by extending Hessian theory to the full Transformer architecture.

Abstract: The lack of theoretical results for Layer Normalization and feedforward
Hessians has left a gap in the study of Transformer optimization landscapes. We
address this by deriving explicit second-order expressions for these
components, thereby completing the Hessian characterization of full Transformer
blocks. Our results generalize prior self-attention analyses and yield
estimations for the role of each sublayer in curvature propagation. We
demonstrate how these Hessian structures inform both convergence dynamics and
the empirical scaling laws governing large-model performance. Further, we
propose a Taylor-expansion-based framework for analyzing loss differences to
quantify convergence trajectories. By extending Hessian theory to the full

Motivation: To develop expressive yet parameter-efficient probabilistic models for time series forecasting that can capture nonlinear and heavy-tailed dynamics, particularly for satellite traffic forecasting where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic resource allocation.

Method: Replace scalar weights in KANs with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterize predictive distributions using Gaussian and Student-t distributions to model uncertainty.

Conclusion: P-KANs establish a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained domains, offering both parameter efficiency and uncertainty modeling capabilities.

Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel
probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series
forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional
connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer
expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and
heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting,
where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource
allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer
Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior
efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build
up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions.
The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for
safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper
distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings
establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with
direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained

*Dania Refai,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a component-level evaluation framework for LLM-generated mathematical optimization formulations, introducing metrics beyond conventional optimality gaps to assess structural and numerical errors in decision variables, constraints, and objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLMs in optimization modeling use coarse metrics like solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors in the formulations, necessitating a more comprehensive, fine-grained evaluation approach.

Method: The study introduces a component-level evaluation framework with metrics including precision/recall for decision variables and constraints, constraint/objective RMSE, and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. It evaluates GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across various optimization problems under six prompting strategies.

Result: GPT-5 consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and modular prompting being most effective. Solver performance primarily depends on high constraint recall and low constraint RMSE, while constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles. Concise outputs enhance computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework establishes three key principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: complete constraint coverage prevents violations, minimizing constraint RMSE ensures solver-level accuracy, and concise outputs improve computational efficiency. This provides a foundation for fine-grained, diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural
language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current
evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like
solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In
this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework
for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our
framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision
variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error
(RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate
GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of
varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5
consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency,
and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver
performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint
RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability.
Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while
concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight
three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint
coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures
solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational
efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained,
diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

*Ganglin Tian,Anastase Alexandre Charantonis,Camille Le Coz,Alexis Tantet,Riwal Plougonven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates three probabilistic deep learning methods for improving spatial uncertainty representation in sub-seasonal wind speed forecasting, showing they outperform simpler stochastic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatial representation of uncertainties when downscaling surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for sub-seasonal forecasting, addressing limitations of previous stochastic perturbation methods that fail to capture spatial correlations and physical consistency.

Method: Evaluated three probabilistic deep learning models with distinct uncertainty quantification mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network, Variational Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models, trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts.

Result: Probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each model offering different strengths in ensemble dispersion, deterministic skill, and physical consistency.

Conclusion: Probabilistic downscaling is established as an effective enhancement to operational sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

Abstract: This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when
regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for
sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale
atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which
exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to
obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)
demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve
ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but
this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency
adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex
relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while
maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer
promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study
evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification
mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models
distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space
sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models
are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts
to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that
probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty
representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic
model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,
deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish
probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational

*Pingzhi Li,Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Qingquan Song,Jie Peng,Kai Zou,Yu Cheng,Kaidi Xu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Knowledge Distillation detection framework that identifies transferred structural patterns, particularly MoE routing habits, achieving >94% accuracy and strong robustness against prompt-based evasion in both white-box and black-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD detection methods are vulnerable to prompt engineering evasion, posing intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks. Current approaches based on self-identity or output similarity fail to capture persistent structural patterns transferred during distillation.

Method: Proposes detection using MoE structural habits (internal routing patterns) that persist through distillation. Introduces Shadow-MoE for black-box scenarios, constructing proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare patterns between arbitrary model pairs.

Result: Achieves >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios, demonstrates strong robustness to prompt-based evasion, and outperforms existing baselines. Comprehensive benchmark with diverse distilled checkpoints enables reproducible evaluation.

Conclusion: Structural habits transfer is a reliable signal for KD detection that persists through distillation. The framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and provides a foundation for future research in intellectual property protection for LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models
(LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks.
Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can
be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection
framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an
overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal
routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and
collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that
persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup
and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that
constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare
these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive,
reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an
extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong
robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while
highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

*Ahmed Khaled,Kaan Ozkara,Tao Yu,Mingyi Hong,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuonBP improves training efficiency by applying block-periodic orthogonalization to reduce communication overhead in model-parallel training while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the communication overhead introduced by gradient orthogonalization in model-parallel training, which causes 5%-10% throughput reduction compared to AdamW.

Method: Proposes MuonBP with block-periodic orthogonalization: applies orthogonalization independently to matrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization. Uses two learning rates for blockwise and full orthogonalization steps.

Result: Achieves 8% throughput increase compared to Muon with no performance degradation when training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO optimizer state sharding.

Conclusion: MuonBP provides competitive iteration complexity with per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods like AdamW, requiring minimal hyperparameter adjustments.

Abstract: Gradient orthogonalization is a simple strategy that shows great utility in
speeding up gradient descent. The Muon optimizer (Jordan, Jin, et al., 2024)
combines gradient orthogonalization with first-order momentum and achieves
significant improvement in data efficiency over Adam/AdamW (Loshchilov and
Hutter, 2019) for language model training. However, when using model
parallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared
to coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and
scatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This
additional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to
Adam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic
Orthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to
matrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization
to maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning
rate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this
algorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for
the blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization
steps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and
achieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while
providing per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such
as AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO
optimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to
Muon with no degradation in performance.

### [161] [Graph4MM: Weaving Multimodal Learning with Structural Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16990)
*Xuying Ning,Dongqi Fu,Tianxin Wei,Wujiang Xu,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph4MM is a graph-based multimodal learning framework that addresses limitations in modeling complex structural relationships across modalities by integrating multi-hop structural information through Hop-Diffused Attention and enabling principled cross-modal fusion via MM-QFormer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal data exhibits complex structural relationships beyond simple one-to-one mappings, with intricate interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references. Previous approaches fail to distinguish multi-hop neighbors and treat graphs as standalone modalities, fragmenting overall understanding.

Method: Proposes Graph4MM framework with two key components: (1) Hop-Diffused Attention that integrates multi-hop structural information into self-attention using causal masking and hop diffusion, and (2) MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for cross-modal fusion.

Result: Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines across both generative and discriminative tasks, achieving a 6.93% average improvement. Theoretical and empirical analysis shows that leveraging structures to integrate intra- and inter-modal interactions improves multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that properly integrating structural information from multi-hop neighbors and fusing modality-specific information in a principled manner significantly enhances multimodal learning beyond treating graphs as standalone modalities.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships
beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities
across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming
diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.
Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and
inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish
multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which
fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key
challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from
multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific
information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the
role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and
propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,
we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural
information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.
Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for
cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that
leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions
improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone
modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that
Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,
achieving a 6.93% average improvement.

*Chang Liu,Danial Chitnis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEschematic is an AI agent that uses a Multimodal Large Language Model to automatically generate human-editable schematic diagrams from SPICE netlists, addressing the visual interpretability gap in current LLM-based circuit design approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based circuit design methods rely on textual representations like SPICE netlists, which lack visual interpretability for circuit designers who need schematic diagrams for understanding and verification.

Method: Uses a Multimodal Large Language Model to integrate textual, visual, and symbolic modalities. Employs six analog substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought strategy for iterative refinement of placement and wiring.

Result: Experimental results on CMOS inverter, five-transistor operational transconductance amplifier, and telescopic cascode amplifier show that EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural correctness.

Conclusion: EEschematic successfully bridges the gap between textual circuit representations and visual schematics, providing an effective automated solution for generating human-interpretable circuit diagrams.

Abstract: Circuit schematics play a crucial role in analog integrated circuit design,
serving as the primary medium for human understanding and verification of
circuit functionality. While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches
have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely
solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual
interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose
EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual,
and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams
represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog
substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought
(VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic
clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits,
including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance
amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that
EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural
correctness.

### [163] [Justitia: Fair and Efficient Scheduling for LLM Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17015)
*Mingyan Yang,Guanjie Wang,Manqi Luo,Yifei Liu,Chen Chen,Han Zhao,Yu Feng,Quan Chen,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Justitia is a novel scheduler for LLM applications that addresses scheduling inefficiencies in shared GPU servers by using memory-centric cost modeling, neural network demand prediction, and virtual-time fair queuing to ensure both efficiency and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM schedulers suffer from head-of-line blocking and over-constrained resource allocation, leading to poor performance for LLM applications in shared GPU environments where fast completion times and worst-case performance guarantees are essential.

Method: Justitia employs three key techniques: memory-centric service cost modeling (since memory is the bottleneck in frameworks like vLLM), lightweight neural network for accurate demand prediction, and virtual-time based fair queuing algorithm to ensure fairness while optimizing performance.

Result: Experimental results show that Justitia implemented on vLLM significantly improves scheduling efficiency while maintaining fairness across diverse LLM applications.

Conclusion: Justitia provides an effective solution for fair and efficient scheduling of LLM applications in shared GPU servers, overcoming limitations of existing schedulers through its memory-aware modeling, predictive capabilities, and fair queuing approach.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has been popular to launch a
series of LLM inferences -- we call an LLM application -- to better solve
real-world problems. When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the
schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed
worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well
for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained
resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a
fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel
scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a
bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the
service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses
a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand
prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing
algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay.
We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving
diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling
efficiency with fairness preserved.

### [164] [Forgetting to Forget: Attention Sink as A Gateway for Backdooring LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17021)
*Bingqi Shang,Yiwei Chen,Yihua Zhang,Bingquan Shen,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'backdoor unlearning' - a vulnerability where LLM unlearning appears successful but secretly embeds triggers that can restore forgotten knowledge. The attack exploits attention sinks in LLMs to create persistent backdoors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of open-weight LLMs, the authors investigate whether unlearning processes can be maliciously manipulated to create hidden backdoors that appear successful under normal conditions but revert to pre-unlearned behavior when triggered.

Method: The researchers design backdoor unlearning attacks by placing triggers at attention sink positions in LLMs and aligning their attention values. They leverage the attention sink phenomenon where shallow input tokens attract disproportionate attention, using these positions as gateways for persistent backdoors.

Result: Extensive experiments show that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores forgotten knowledge when backdoor triggers are present, while behaving indistinguishably from normally unlearned models when triggers are absent. The method demonstrates strong backdoor persistence.

Conclusion: Attention sinks serve as effective gateways for backdoor unlearning attacks, creating a significant security vulnerability in LLM unlearning processes where models can secretly retain and restore forgotten knowledge through hidden triggers.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical mechanism for
removing undesired data, knowledge, or behaviors from pre-trained models while
retaining their general utility. Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we
ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful
under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden
trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that
embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate
backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but
recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing
such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed
and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between
backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens
consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing
triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly
enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings,
showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores
forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving
indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

*Nguyen Do,Bach Ngo,Youval Kashuv,Canh V. Pham,Hanghang Tong,My T. Thai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIMMA is a self-reinforcing generative framework that addresses Quality of Service Degradation (QoSD) by synthesizing feasible solutions through three phases: Forge (predictive path-stressing), Morph (mixture of conditional VAEs), and Refine (reinforcement learning).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The QoSD problem involves adversaries perturbing edge weights to degrade network performance, which affects both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems. Existing methods either rely on combinatorial optimization or only handle restricted linear variants with small networks, leaving nonlinear edge-weight functions unaddressed.

Method: PIMMA uses a three-phase approach: (1) Forge - Predictive Path-Stressing algorithm using graph learning and approximation, (2) Morph - Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by energy-based model to capture solution distributions, (3) Refine - Reinforcement learning agent with differentiable reward function to generate near-optimal solutions.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks show PIMMA consistently outperforms classical and ML baselines, especially in scenarios with nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.

Conclusion: PIMMA effectively addresses the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions, filling a critical gap in existing approaches and demonstrating superior performance compared to both classical optimization and machine learning baselines.

Abstract: We study the Quality of Service Degradation (QoSD) problem, in which an
adversary perturbs edge weights to degrade network performance. This setting
arises in both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems, where
communication quality, not just connectivity, determines functionality. While
classical methods rely on combinatorial optimization, and recent ML approaches
address only restricted linear variants with small-size networks, no prior
model directly tackles the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions.
This work proposes \PIMMA, a self-reinforcing generative framework that
synthesizes feasible solutions in latent space, to fill this gap. Our method
includes three phases: (1) Forge: a Predictive Path-Stressing (PPS) algorithm
that uses graph learning and approximation to produce feasible solutions with
performance guarantee, (2) Morph: a new theoretically grounded training
paradigm for Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to
capture solution feature distributions, and (3) Refine: a reinforcement
learning agent that explores this space to generate progressively near-optimal
solutions using our designed differentiable reward function. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world networks show that our approach consistently
outperforms classical and ML baselines, particularly in scenarios with
nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.

TL;DR: DICA framework uses Jacobian Volume Maximization to identify latent components from nonlinear mixtures by promoting diversity in their influence on observed variables, achieving identifiability without auxiliary signals or independence assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenge of identifying latent components from unknown nonlinear mixtures, which has applications in disentangled representation learning and causal inference, without relying on auxiliary signals or strong structural assumptions.

Method: Proposes Diverse Influence Component Analysis (DICA) with Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax) criterion that exploits the convex geometry of the mixing function's Jacobian to encourage diversity in latent components' influence on observed variables.

Result: The approach achieves identifiability of latent components under reasonable conditions without requiring auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity assumptions.

Conclusion: DICA extends the scope of identifiability analysis in nonlinear ICA and provides a complementary perspective to existing methods by leveraging geometric properties of the mixing function rather than statistical or structural constraints.

Abstract: Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a
foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as
disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in
nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary
signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of
conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore
structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function,
to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence
Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the
mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization
(J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by
encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under
reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying
on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity
assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and
offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.

*Nikolaus Howe,Micah Carroll*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLMs engage in motivated reasoning when post-hoc instructions conflict with learned behaviors, finding that models generate plausible justifications for violating instructions while downplaying harms, and that detection capability varies across model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what happens to models' reasoning processes when post-hoc instructions conflict with learned behaviors, particularly in the context of detecting harmful behaviors through chain-of-thought monitoring.

Method: The researchers investigate this question in simple settings, examining how models generate justifications for violating instructions and testing the detection capability of different-sized LLM judges.

Result: Models engage in systematic motivated reasoning - generating plausible-sounding justifications while downplaying potential harms. While most frontier reasoning models can detect this motivated reasoning, smaller LLM judges often fail to identify it and can sometimes be persuaded that the flawed reasoning is correct.

Conclusion: The capability gap in detecting motivated reasoning raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult to detect, underscoring the need to account for this phenomenon when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight.

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language
models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a
compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under
the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal
decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors
due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned
tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to
avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's
reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We
investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in
systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications
for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond
being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated
reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges
can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be
persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear
instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more
sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for
monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated
reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and
oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some
examples in this paper may be upsetting.

*Hassan Hamad,Yuou Qiu,Peter A. Beerel,Keith M. Chugg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training method with hardware-friendly approximations, achieving comparable accuracy to 32-bit floating-point training while significantly reducing hardware area and energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning training relies heavily on complex floating-point arithmetic, which is computationally expensive. Low-precision fixed-point training offers a promising alternative to reduce computational costs and enable more efficient hardware accelerator designs.

Method: The authors propose incorporating bitwidth in arithmetic operation approximations and introduce a hardware-friendly piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition. They use simulated annealing to optimize approximations at different precision levels and validate through C++ bit-true simulations.

Result: The method successfully trains VGG-11 and VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet using 12-bit integer arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point training. Hardware analysis shows 32.5% area reduction and 53.5% energy reduction for LNS multiply-accumulate units.

Conclusion: Low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training is a viable approach that maintains training accuracy while significantly improving hardware efficiency, making it suitable for future hardware accelerator designs.

Abstract: While advancements in quantization have significantly reduced the
computational costs of inference in deep learning, training still predominantly
relies on complex floating-point arithmetic. Low-precision fixed-point training
presents a compelling alternative. This work introduces a novel enhancement in
low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training, geared towards future hardware
accelerator designs. We propose incorporating bitwidth in the design of
approximations to arithmetic operations. To this end, we introduce a new
hardware-friendly, piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition.
Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different
precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and
VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer
arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point
training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5%
reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units
compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.

*Kathryn Wantlin,Chongyi Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised pre-training method for interactive agents that enables them to instantly mimic human demonstrations by treating goals as atomic constructs and practicing goal-reaching during training, then solving inverse reinforcement learning during evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models (VLMs, LLMs) are trained without explicit action concepts and rely on human-provided data, which assumes humans spend most time in rewarding states. There's a need for embodied agents that can train interactively and quickly adapt to new tasks through self-supervised exploration.

Method: The method treats goals (observations) as atomic constructs. During training, it automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them using reinforcement learning exploration techniques. During evaluation, it solves an amortized inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks (not specifically designed for goal-reaching) show that the approach outperforms prior methods for zero-shot imitation.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised pre-training method enables interactive agents to effectively learn goal-reaching behaviors and achieve superior zero-shot imitation performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: In the same way that generative models today conduct most of their training
in a self-supervised fashion, how can agentic models conduct their training in
a self-supervised fashion, interactively exploring, learning, and preparing to
quickly adapt to new tasks? A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real
world interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most
successful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion
of action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is
well studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with
a wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation
to new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided
by humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that
the model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a
sonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to
solve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of
their time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a
method for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so
that they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals
(i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method
automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior
work in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method
solves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain
demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard
benchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms
prior methods for zero-shot imitation.

### [171] [Explainable Heterogeneous Anomaly Detection in Financial Networks via Adaptive Expert Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17088)
*Zan Li,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive graph learning framework with specialized expert networks for interpretable financial anomaly detection that identifies specific anomaly mechanisms rather than providing uniform scalar scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial anomaly detectors treat all anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents targeted regulatory responses.

Method: The framework uses adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks, capturing multi-scale temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fusing temporal and spatial information via cross-modal attention, learning dynamic graphs through neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balancing learned dynamics with structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, and routing anomalies to four mechanism-specific experts.

Result: On 100 US equities (2017-2024), the method achieves 92.3% detection of 13 major events with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8 percentage points. Silicon Valley Bank case study shows automatic temporal mechanism identification without labeled supervision.

Conclusion: The framework provides dual-level interpretable attributions with interpretability embedded architecturally rather than applied post-hoc, enabling targeted regulatory responses by revealing specific anomaly mechanisms and their temporal evolution.

Abstract: Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity
freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all
anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism
is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents
targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static
graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime
changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across
multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with
network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on
anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.
  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks
that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale
temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and
spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through
neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with
structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four
mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions.
Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied
post-hoc.
  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events
with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley
Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert
weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48
(66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism
identification without labeled supervision.

### [172] [On the Universal Near Optimality of Hedge in Combinatorial Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17099)
*Zhiyuan Fan,Arnab Maiti,Kevin Jamieson,Lillian J. Ratliff,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the optimality of the Hedge algorithm in combinatorial online learning settings. It shows Hedge is near-optimal with a ‚àölog d factor gap, identifies specific settings where Hedge is suboptimal, proves its optimality for online multitask learning, and establishes near-optimal regularizers for DAG shortest-path problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the classical Hedge algorithm is optimal across all combinatorial online learning settings, as it's known to achieve O(‚àöT log|X|) regret but its fundamental optimality wasn't fully understood.

Method: The authors establish a general lower bound of Œ©(‚àöT log(|X|)/log d) for any algorithm, analyze specific combinatorial structures (m-sets), prove Hedge's optimality for online multitask learning, and show iterate-equivalence between Online Mirror Descent with dilated entropy and Hedge for DAGs.

Result: Hedge is near-optimal with at most ‚àölog d factor gap from optimal, but is provably suboptimal by exactly ‚àölog d for m-sets where log d ‚â§ m ‚â§ ‚àöd. Hedge is optimal for online multitask learning, and near-optimal regularizers exist for DAG shortest-path problems.

Conclusion: Hedge is near-optimal across combinatorial settings with a tight ‚àölog d factor gap, optimal for some problems like multitask learning, and its near-optimality enables finding near-optimal regularizers for broader combinatorial domains via iterate-equivalence with OMD.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial
settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a
set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t
\rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,
including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask
learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is
well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after
$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal
across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X
\subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log
d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log
d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of
combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for
which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by
a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is
optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical
$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to
establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path
problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial
domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)
algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is
iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret
guarantees for DAGs.

*Chen Zhang,Weixin Bu,Wendong Xu,Runsheng Yu,Yik-Chung Wu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes equivalence between Transformer encoders and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), showing attention matrices act as dynamic adjacency matrices and proposing Fighter - a streamlined architecture that removes redundant projections while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify Transformer internal mechanisms in time series modeling by revealing their fundamental equivalence to GCNs, providing clearer interpretability of temporal dependencies.

Method: Theoretical analysis showing attention distribution as dynamic adjacency matrix, then proposing Fighter architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates multi-hop graph aggregation for explicit temporal dependency representation.

Result: Experiments on standard forecasting benchmarks confirm Fighter achieves competitive performance while providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of predictions.

Conclusion: Transformers can be fundamentally reinterpreted as GCNs, enabling more interpretable architectures like Fighter that maintain performance while offering explicit representations of temporal dependencies as graph edges.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success in time series modeling, yet
their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This work demystifies the Transformer
encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution
matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with
subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph
convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update
dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters.
Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose
\textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined
architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates
multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and
interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales,
naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting
benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while
providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.

### [174] [Do LLMs Recognize Your Latent Preferences? A Benchmark for Latent Information Discovery in Personalized Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17132)
*Ioannis Tsaknakis,Bingqing Song,Shuyu Gan,Dongyeop Kang,Alfredo Garcia,Gaowen Liu,Charles Fleming,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to discover latent user information through conversation, showing performance varies from 32% to 98% depending on task complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with user-specific preferences when users don't explicitly state all their needs, requiring inference of latent information through dialogue.

Method: Created a unified benchmark with tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) across three settings: 20 Questions game, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization.

Result: LLMs can surface latent information through dialogue but success varies dramatically (32% to 98%) based on task complexity, topic, and number of hidden attributes.

Conclusion: Effective preference inference remains an open frontier for building truly adaptive AI systems, and the benchmark provides the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but
this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are
required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these
scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much
of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a
fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information
through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating
latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden
user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three
progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized
Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a
tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of
elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed
surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically
with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number
of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework
for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,
highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for
building truly adaptive AI systems.

### [175] [In-situ Autoguidance: Eliciting Self-Correction in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17136)
*Enhao Gu,Haolin Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In-situ Autoguidance enables diffusion models to self-correct during inference without needing auxiliary models, achieving better image quality and prompt alignment while maintaining diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-free guidance improves image quality and alignment but reduces variation, and existing disentanglement methods require separate auxiliary models which adds overhead.

Method: Dynamic generation of inferior predictions using stochastic forward passes during inference, treating guidance as self-correction without external components.

Result: Zero-cost approach proves viable and establishes a powerful baseline for cost-efficient guidance, achieving self-guidance benefits without external models.

Conclusion: In-situ Autoguidance successfully demonstrates that self-guidance can be achieved without auxiliary models, providing an efficient solution to the quality-diversity trade-off in diffusion models.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality, diverse, and prompt-aligned images is a
central goal in image-generating diffusion models. The popular classifier-free
guidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced
variation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has
successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately
trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the
considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this
prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits
guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach
dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic
forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction.
We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also
establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that
the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.

### [176] [Learning After Model Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17160)
*Derda Kaymak,Gyuhak Kim,Tomoya Kaichi,Tatsuya Konishi,Bing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Autonomous Learning after Model Deployment (ALMD), a paradigm where models continuously detect novel samples from unseen classes and learn them incrementally after labeling, without human engineers. It proposes PLDA method to address dynamic OOD detection and incremental learning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised learning with fixed deployed models is unsuitable for dynamic environments where unexpected samples from unseen classes appear. Models need to autonomously detect and learn new classes continuously during application.

Method: Proposes PLDA method that performs dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Unlike traditional OOD detection, the in-distribution class set expands as new classes are learned.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA in addressing the challenges of ALMD.

Conclusion: ALMD enables continuous learning in dynamic environments, and PLDA provides an effective solution for dynamic OOD detection and incremental learning of new classes during model deployment.

Abstract: In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application,
it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is
inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples
from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be
able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after
they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model
Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human
engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other
knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an
unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection
of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new
classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in
traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised
learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and
incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the
past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered
classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two
challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes
often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and
incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will
demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.

### [177] [ALPINE: A Lightweight and Adaptive Privacy-Decision Agent Framework for Dynamic Edge Crowdsensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17162)
*Guanjie Cheng,Siyang Liu,Junqin Huang,Xinkui Zhao,Yin Wang,Mengying Zhu,Linghe Kong,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALPINE is an adaptive differential privacy framework for mobile edge crowdsensing that dynamically adjusts privacy levels in real-time using a TD3-based control system to balance privacy protection, data utility, and energy costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static differential privacy mechanisms fail to adapt to evolving risks in mobile edge crowdsensing environments, leading to either excessive noise or inadequate protection against privacy threats.

Method: ALPINE uses a closed-loop control system with four modules: dynamic risk perception, privacy decision via TD3 algorithm, local privacy execution, and performance verification from edge nodes. It employs a reward function balancing privacy gains, data utility, and energy cost.

Result: Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations show ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge applications.

Conclusion: ALPINE provides a lightweight, adaptive framework that enables terminal devices to autonomously adjust differential privacy levels in real-time, achieving dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility, and cost in resource-constrained edge environments.

Abstract: Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit
user data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to
significant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms
build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to
adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,
resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise
or inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a
lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously
adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a
closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,
privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),
local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on
environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances
privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to
adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a
dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative
risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead
deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations
demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while
preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge
applications.

*Runlin Lei,Lu Yi,Mingguo He,Pengyu Qiu,Zhewei Wei,Yongchao Liu,Chuntao Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework to evaluate robustness of GNNs, RGNNs, and GraphLLMs on Text-Attributed Graphs, revealing inherent robustness trade-offs and proposing SFT-auto for balanced robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of GNNs and LLMs on TAGs are fragmented, lacking systematic investigation of textual and structural perturbations across different models and attack scenarios.

Method: Developed a comprehensive evaluation framework testing classical GNNs, robust GNNs, and GraphLLMs across 10 datasets under text-based, structure-based, and hybrid perturbations in poisoning and evasion scenarios.

Result: Key findings: 1) inherent robustness trade-offs between text and structure, 2) GNN performance depends on text encoder and attack type, 3) GraphLLMs are vulnerable to training data corruption. SFT-auto framework achieves superior balanced robustness.

Conclusion: The work establishes foundation for TAG security research and provides practical solutions for robust TAG learning in adversarial environments.

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are
powerful approaches for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), a
comprehensive understanding of their robustness remains elusive. Current
evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct
effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and
attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and
comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework
evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten
datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and
hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive
analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly
noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and
structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text
encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to
training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce
SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness
against both textual and structural attacks within a single model. Our work
establishes a foundation for future research on TAG security and offers
practical solutions for robust TAG learning in adversarial environments. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/Leirunlin/TGRB.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular benchmarking framework for protein molecular dynamics methods that addresses validation challenges through enhanced sampling analysis, standardized metrics, and reproducible benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of standardized tools for molecular dynamics method validation, inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of rare states, and absence of reproducible benchmarks that hinder objective comparison between simulation approaches.

Method: Uses weighted ensemble sampling via WESTPA based on TICA-derived progress coordinates for efficient conformational exploration. Features a flexible propagator interface supporting arbitrary simulation engines (classical force fields and ML models) and a comprehensive evaluation suite with 19+ metrics and visualizations.

Result: Developed a dataset of nine diverse proteins (10-224 residues) with extensive simulations. Demonstrated framework utility through validation tests comparing classic MD with implicit solvent and CGSchNet models (fully trained vs under-trained), showing effective conformational sampling analysis.

Conclusion: The open-source platform standardizes evaluation protocols and enables direct, reproducible comparisons across MD approaches, establishing groundwork for consistent, rigorous benchmarking in the molecular simulation community.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, including
machine-learned dynamics, has outpaced the development of standardized tools
for method validation. Objective comparison between simulation approaches is
often hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of
rare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To
address these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.
Our approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble
Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on
progress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis
(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational
space. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that
supports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and
machine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a
comprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different
metrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a
dataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a
variety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been
extensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4
ns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests
using classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein
conformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet
model. By standardizing evaluation protocols and enabling direct, reproducible
comparisons across MD approaches, our open-source platform lays the groundwork
for consistent, rigorous benchmarking across the molecular simulation
community.

*Wenxun Wang,Shuchang Zhou,Wenyu Sun,Peiqin Sun,Yongpan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOLE is a hardware-software co-design that optimizes Softmax and LayerNorm operations in Transformers through E2Softmax (using log2 quantization and log-based division) and AILayerNorm (using low-precision statistics), achieving significant speedup and energy efficiency without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have performance limitations in real-time inference due to inefficient Softmax and LayerNorm operations. Previous approximation methods suffer from high memory overhead and require costly retraining to compensate for errors.

Method: SOLE combines E2Softmax (log2 quantization of exponent function and log-based division) and AILayerNorm (low-precision statistic calculation) to achieve both low-precision calculation and low bit-width storage.

Result: SOLE maintains inference accuracy without retraining while achieving 3.04x and 3.86x energy-efficiency improvements, and 2.82x and 3.32x area-efficiency improvements over prior state-of-the-art custom hardware for Softmax and LayerNorm respectively.

Conclusion: SOLE provides an effective hardware-software co-design solution that significantly improves Transformer efficiency for Softmax and LayerNorm operations without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Transformers have shown remarkable performance in both natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, their real-time
inference speed and efficiency are limited due to the inefficiency in Softmax
and Layer Normalization (LayerNorm). Previous works based on function
approximation suffer from inefficient implementation as they place emphasis on
computation while disregarding memory overhead concerns. Moreover, such methods
rely on retraining to compensate for approximation error which can be costly
and inconvenient.
  In this paper, we present SOLE, a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and
LayerNorm which is composed of E2Softmax and AILayerNorm. E2Softmax utilizes
log2 quantization of exponent function and log-based division to approximate
Softmax while AILayerNorm adopts low-precision statistic calculation. Compared
with state-of-the-art designs, we achieve both low-precision calculation and
low bit-width storage on Softmax and LayerNorm. Experiments show that SOLE
maintains inference accuracy without retraining while offering orders of
magnitude speedup and energy savings over GPU, achieving 3.04x, 3.86x
energy-efficiency improvements and 2.82x, 3.32x area-efficiency improvements
over prior state-of-the-art custom hardware for Softmax and LayerNorm,
respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework for high-risk-high-return tasks that addresses multimodal action distributions through action discretization, entropy-regularized exploration, and dual-critic architecture, outperforming baselines in locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-risk-high-return tasks exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns, but most RL methods use unimodal Gaussian policies and scalar critics, limiting their effectiveness in such settings. The authors formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically prove Gaussian policies cannot guarantee optimal convergence.

Method: The framework (i) discretizes continuous action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate discrete value distribution estimation. It scales to high-dimensional action spaces.

Result: Experiments on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high failure risks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The results underscore the importance of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in reinforcement learning for high-risk-high-return tasks, showing that the proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional Gaussian policy approaches.

Abstract: Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle
crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns.
Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and
rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR
settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian
policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this,
we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous
action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs
entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding
actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate
discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to
high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments
on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure
demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance
of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

Motivation: High-frequency impedance is crucial for assessing fuel cell health but online testing is complex and costly, necessitating alternative diagnostic methods.

Method: The paper employs a deep sparse auto-encoding network for prediction and classification of high-frequency impedance, with deployment on FPGA hardware.

Result: The method achieves accuracy rate above 92% for prediction and classification, with FPGA implementation attaining nearly 90% hardware-based recognition rate.

Conclusion: The deep sparse auto-encoding network provides an effective solution for fuel cell health diagnosis, successfully bridging the gap between complex online testing and practical deployment through FPGA implementation.

Abstract: Effective and accurate diagnosis of fuel cell health status is crucial for
ensuring the stable operation of fuel cell stacks. Among various parameters,
high-frequency impedance serves as a critical indicator for assessing fuel cell

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes AttEnc and P-AttEnc deep learning architectures for driver identification using attention mechanisms and few-shot learning to address data shortages and unknown driver classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver identification is important for data-driven applications but biometric methods raise privacy concerns. Most existing methods don't handle data shortages well and are inflexible with unknown drivers.

Method: Developed two architectures: AttEnc (attention-based encoder) for efficient driver identification with fewer parameters, and P-AttEnc (combining prototypical network with AttEnc) for few-shot learning to handle data shortages and unknown drivers.

Result: AttEnc achieved 99.3%, 99.0%, and 99.9% accuracy across three datasets with 44-79% faster prediction time and 87.6% parameter reduction. P-AttEnc achieved 69.8% accuracy in one-shot scenario and 65.7% average accuracy for unknown driver classification.

Conclusion: The proposed architectures effectively address driver identification challenges - AttEnc provides efficient high-accuracy identification while P-AttEnc enables few-shot learning for data-scarce scenarios and unknown driver classification.

Abstract: Driver identification has become an area of increasing interest in recent
years, especially for data- driven applications, because biometric-based
technologies may incur privacy issues. This study proposes a deep learning
neural network architecture, an attention-based encoder (AttEnc), which uses an
attention mechanism for driver identification and uses fewer model parameters
than current methods. Most studies do not address the issue of data shortages
for driver identification, and most of them are inflexible when encountering
unknown drivers. In this study, an architecture that combines a prototypical
network and an attention-based encoder (P-AttEnc) is proposed. It applies
few-shot learning to overcome the data shortage issues and to enhance model
generalizations. The experiments showed that the attention-based encoder can
identify drivers with accuracies of 99.3%, 99.0% and 99.9% in three different
datasets and has a prediction time that is 44% to 79% faster because it
significantly reduces, on average, 87.6% of the model parameters. P-AttEnc
identifies drivers based on few shot data, extracts driver fingerprints to
address the issue of data shortages, and is able to classify unknown drivers.
The first experiment showed that P-AttEnc can identify drivers with an accuracy
of 69.8% in the one-shot scenario. The second experiment showed that P-AttEnc,
in the 1-shot scenario, can classify unknown drivers with an average accuracy
of 65.7%.

*Rishi Jha,Harold Triedman,Justin Wagle,Vitaly Shmatikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ControlValve defends against control-flow hijacking in multi-agent systems by generating permitted control-flow graphs and enforcing execution compliance with contextual rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses like LlamaFirewall are insufficient against control-flow hijacking attacks due to brittle alignment definitions and incomplete execution context visibility, creating a fundamental conflict between safety and functionality.

Method: ControlValve generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems and enforces execution compliance with these graphs using zero-shot generated contextual rules for each agent invocation.

Result: The paper demonstrates that current alignment-based defenses can be evaded even with advanced LLM checkers, and proposes ControlValve as a more robust alternative.

Conclusion: ControlValve provides a principled defense against control-flow hijacking by combining control-flow integrity and least privilege principles, addressing fundamental limitations in existing alignment-based approaches.

Abstract: Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in
multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system
and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as
LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure
that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the
original objective.
  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these
defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that
the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally
conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle
definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the
execution context.
  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired
by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve
(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)
enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual

### [185] [MemoryBench: A Benchmark for Memory and Continual Learning in LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17281)
*Qingyao Ai,Yichen Tang,Changyue Wang,Jianming Long,Weihang Su,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new benchmark for evaluating LLM memory and continual learning abilities using simulated user feedback across multiple domains, languages, and task types, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM scaling methods are reaching limits due to data depletion and diminishing returns. Inspired by human learning from practice, there's growing interest in memory and continual learning for LLMs, but existing benchmarks focus on homogeneous reading comprehension rather than learning from user feedback during service.

Method: Developed a user feedback simulation framework and comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and task types to evaluate LLM continual learning abilities from accumulated user interactions.

Result: Experiments revealed that state-of-the-art baselines show unsatisfactory effectiveness and efficiency in learning from user feedback, indicating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark provides a foundation for future research on LLM memory and optimization algorithms, addressing the gap in evaluating continual learning from real-world user interactions.

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the
mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are
almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal
gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the
abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice,
constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an
important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing
benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous
reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their
abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore,
we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark
covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the
continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness
and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we
hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and
optimization algorithms.

*Tal Barami,Nimrod Berman,Ilan Naiman,Amos H. Hason,Rotem Ezra,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first standardized benchmark for multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets, proposes a post-hoc latent exploration stage and Koopman-inspired model, and shows that Vision-Language Models can automate evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work has focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings due to easier data collection, overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world sequential data involving multiple interacting semantic factors over time.

Method: The authors introduce a standardized benchmark with tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics. They propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage for automatic latent dimension alignment and a Koopman-inspired model. They also utilize Vision-Language Models for automated dataset annotation and zero-shot evaluation.

Result: The proposed Koopman-inspired model achieves state-of-the-art results. Vision-Language Models successfully automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, eliminating the need for manual labels and human intervention.

Conclusion: These contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement across vision, audio, and time series domains.

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in
deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While
real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior
work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings,
primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby
overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce
the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential
disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time
series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model
development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We
additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align
latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model
that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language
Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement
evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.
Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for
advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free framework for reward modeling that uses query-specific rubrics and information-theoretic optimization to achieve high data efficiency and interpretability with minimal preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models for LLM alignment face challenges with costly preference datasets and poor interpretability, creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Propose-Evaluate-Revise pipeline for query-specific rubrics, 2) Information-theoretic coding rate optimization to generalize rubrics into compact hierarchical Theme-Tips sets.

Result: Exceptional data efficiency using only 70 preference pairs (1.5% of source data), enabling smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized fully-trained counterparts.

Conclusion: Pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and data-efficient path for reward modeling by leveraging rubric generalization across diverse queries.

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
human values, yet their development is hampered by costly preference datasets
and poor interpretability. While recent rubric-based approaches offer
transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization,
creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these
limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption:
\textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant
generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables
remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality,
query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided
\textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these
granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an
\textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an
interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance.
Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our
method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized,
fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and
data-efficient path for reward modeling.

### [188] [Localist LLMs with Recruitment Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17358)
*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for training LLMs with adjustable internal representations from interpretable localist to efficient distributed encodings, featuring a tunable locality dial, adaptive semantic block allocation, and hierarchical recruitment of specialized LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable continuous interpolation between interpretable and high-performance modes in LLMs while adapting architectural capacity at multiple granularities, particularly for regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

Method: Uses group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood with explicit units. Includes a locality dial parameter, information-theoretic recruitment mechanism, and hierarchical recruitment framework.

Result: Provides rigorous mathematical results establishing explicit threshold conditions for attention concentration on semantically relevant blocks, with exact bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism provides convergence guarantees at both block and LLM levels.

Conclusion: The framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an
information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic
blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at
initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends
capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity
architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on
attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule
injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood
with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing
explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on
semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on
attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism
provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained,
within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the
system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data
encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously
interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting
architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in
regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

*Wei Xu,Xiaoyi Jiang,Lixiang Xu,Dechao Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates invariance properties in graph neural networks (GNNs) using a metamer generation technique, revealing excessive representational invariance in current GNN architectures compared to human-like invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the invariance behavior in GNNs and compare it with human brain invariance mechanisms, as significant gaps have been identified in visual and auditory domains between artificial neural networks and humans.

Method: Developed a model metamer generation technique by optimizing input graphs to match internal node activations of reference graphs, creating structurally different but representationally equivalent graphs. Theoretical analysis focused on local metamer dimension and activation-induced volume change.

Result: Found extreme levels of representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Targeted architectural modifications and training strategies only partially mitigated excessive invariance but failed to bridge the gap to human-like invariance.

Conclusion: Current GNNs exhibit unique failure modes due to excessive invariance, and the metamer approach provides a complementary benchmark for model evaluation, highlighting the fundamental gap between artificial and human invariance properties.

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in
perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to
emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies
in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain
between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of
humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks
(GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing
input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a
reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's
representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node
features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer
dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the
metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of
representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although
targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can
partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge
the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between
metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes
of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as surrogate models to replace costly smart grid simulators in Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Power Flow optimization, significantly improving sample efficiency and training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement Learning faces sample efficiency problems in smart grid optimization due to the need for extensive iterations through costly simulators to obtain optimal policies.

Method: Substitute expensive smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to optimize RL policy training.

Result: The approach achieves convergent results in a fraction of the time required by the original environment.

Conclusion: PINN-based surrogate models effectively address the sample efficiency problem in RL for smart grid energy management, enabling faster convergence and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Optimizing the energy management within a smart grids scenario presents
significant challenges, primarily due to the complexity of real-world systems
and the intricate interactions among various components. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of
Optimal Power Flow in smart grids. However, RL needs to iterate compulsively
throughout a given environment to obtain the optimal policy. This means
obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a
sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by
substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using
Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training
process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by
the original environment.

### [191] [Beyond Binary Out-of-Distribution Detection: Characterizing Distributional Shifts with Multi-Statistic Diffusion Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17381)
*Achref Jaziri,Martin Rogmann,Martin Mundt,Visvanathan Ramesh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISC introduces a diffusion-based method for out-of-distribution detection that goes beyond binary classification to identify specific OOD types, outperforming traditional scalar-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods collapse distributional shifts into single scalar scores, making it impossible to distinguish between different types of OOD data needed for appropriate action and open-ended learning.

Method: DISC leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract rich, multi-dimensional feature vectors that capture statistical discrepancies across multiple noise levels.

Result: Extensive experiments on image and tabular benchmarks show DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for OOD detection and uniquely classifies OOD types, a capability largely absent from prior work.

Conclusion: DISC enables a shift from simple binary OOD detection to more granular detection, allowing proper contextualization and prospective exploitation of OOD data.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is critical for machine learning, be
it for safety reasons or to enable open-ended learning. However, beyond mere
detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the
type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not
distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse
distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that
scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly
contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the
introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC
leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a
rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies
across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular
benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for
OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely
absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary
OOD detection to a more granular detection.

*Ludovica Schaerf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how generative visual models' internal representations have evolved from GANs/VAEs to diffusion models, proposing a distinction between strict synthesis (compact latent space) and broad synthesis (distributed representations across layers).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conceptual shift in generative AI from unified latent spaces to distributed representations, challenging traditional assumptions about how models synthesize content.

Method: Close readings of model architectures and experimental interventions in layerwise representations of diffusion models to analyze how representation is fragmented.

Result: Diffusion models distribute representational labor across layers rather than relying on unified latent spaces, challenging the Platonic Representation Hypothesis.

Conclusion: Generative AI should be understood as emergent configurations of specialized processes rather than direct synthesis of content, requiring reorientation of how we conceptualize these models.

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in
generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from
GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's
account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we
propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact
latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a
broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is
distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a
targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we
show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby
challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings
within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such
as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a
reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of
content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.

*Pengxiang Cai,Zihao Gao,Jintai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabR1 is the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction that uses multi-step reasoning and a novel reinforcement learning method called PRPO to achieve strong performance with limited supervision while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tabular prediction methods like gradient-boosted trees and specialized deep learning models have limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables, while reasoning LLMs promise cross-task adaptability with transparent reasoning but haven't been fully realized for tabular data.

Method: TabR1 uses Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior by constructing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations.

Result: TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision, approaches 32-shot baseline performance in zero-shot setting, and substantially outperforms much larger LLMs (8B model achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 685B).

Conclusion: PRPO effectively activates LLM reasoning abilities for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot/zero-shot performance and interpretability while demonstrating strong generalization across various tasks.

Abstract: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision
trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but
provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning
large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent
reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular
data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction
with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy
Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that
encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing
multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages
both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense
learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO
activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing
few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong
baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1
approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.
Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various
tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration for average-reward offline RL with function approximation, achieving the first sample complexity results for weakly communicating MDPs without restrictive ergodicity or linearity assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on average-reward offline RL relied on restrictive assumptions like ergodicity or linearity, while discounted-return settings had extensive analysis. This work addresses the gap by providing sample complexity results for the more general weakly communicating MDPs.

Method: The authors propose Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines standard Fitted Q-Iteration with an anchor mechanism (interpreted as a form of weight decay) to enable finite-time analysis in the average-reward setting.

Result: The method achieves the first sample complexity results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation under weakly communicating MDPs. The analysis also extends to single-trajectory datasets rather than requiring IID transitions.

Conclusion: The anchor mechanism is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in average-reward offline RL, and the approach successfully addresses the limitations of prior work by working with milder assumptions and more realistic data generation settings.

Abstract: Although there is an extensive body of work characterizing the sample
complexity of discounted-return offline RL with function approximations, prior
work on the average-reward setting has received significantly less attention,
and existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as ergodicity or
linearity of the MDP. In this work, we establish the first sample complexity
results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly
communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce
Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration
with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as
a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the
average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup
where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID
transitions, again leveraging the anchor mechanism.

*Alejandro Guerra-Manzanares,Farah E. Shamout*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MILES is a learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts rates during multimodal training to balance modality usage, preventing overfitting to single modalities and improving both multimodal and unimodal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal networks often suffer from modality overfitting where they rely excessively on one modality, leading to sub-optimal performance and marginal improvements over unimodal models.

Method: MILES leverages modality-wise conditional utilization rate differences during training to dynamically adjust learning rates, balancing the speed of learning from each modality in multimodal joint fusion models.

Result: MILES outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines across four multimodal joint fusion tasks, effectively balancing modality usage and improving both multimodal performance and modality encoder strength.

Conclusion: Balancing multimodal learning through dynamic learning rate adjustment significantly improves model performance and creates stronger modality encoders that benefit unimodal scenarios.

Abstract: The aim of multimodal neural networks is to combine diverse data sources,
referred to as modalities, to achieve enhanced performance compared to relying
on a single modality. However, training of multimodal networks is typically
hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one
of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,
hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal
improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the
Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint
fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in
modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively
balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during
training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal
model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal
predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion
tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our
results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion
methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during
training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality
encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent
modalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal
learning on improving model performance.

TL;DR: S4ECG is a novel deep learning architecture using structured state space models for multi-epoch ECG arrhythmia classification, achieving superior performance over single-epoch approaches with improved temporal dependency analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ECG analysis methods struggle to capture both global trends and local waveform features simultaneously at high temporal resolution, limiting comprehensive understanding of cardiac dynamics.

Method: Introduced S4ECG architecture leveraging structured state space models for multi-epoch arrhythmia classification, enabling joint analysis across multiple time windows.

Result: Multi-epoch predictions outperformed single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC, with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998, showing enhanced in-distribution and out-of-distribution robustness.

Conclusion: This work enables a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia detection, particularly beneficial for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, with optimal temporal dependency windows of 10-20 minutes.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with
continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and
pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven
challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local
waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal
resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a
novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for
multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions
significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC,
with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998,
demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced
out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal
temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This
work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia
detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in
particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but challenging due to stochastic aging processes.

Method: Proposes CDUA method combining diffusion-based generative model with attention mechanisms, using Pearson correlation and XGBoost for feature selection, and U-Net with self-attention for temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieves relative MAE of 0.94%, RMSE of 1.14%, and 95% confidence interval width of 3.74% on real-world vehicle data, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable uncertainty quantification, demonstrating robustness and superior performance over mainstream methods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated
uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains
challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel
method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which
integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The
proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series
forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive
performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle
operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the
Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are
used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a
contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies,
and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy
observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data
demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%,
with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results
confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable
uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its
robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAP (Diffusion As Priors) is a training-free framework that enhances dataset distillation by incorporating diffusion model priors to improve representativeness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets like ImageNet-1K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative dataset distillation methods using diffusion models overlook the inherent representativeness prior in these models, requiring external constraints to enhance data quality. The challenge is achieving diversity, generalization, and representativeness simultaneously in distilled datasets.

Method: DAP formalizes representativeness by quantifying similarity between synthetic and real data in feature space using a Mercer kernel, then introduces this prior as guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process without any retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and its subsets show DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating high-fidelity datasets and achieves superior cross-architecture generalization.

Conclusion: The work establishes a theoretical connection between diffusion priors and dataset distillation objectives while providing a practical, training-free framework for improving distilled dataset quality.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets from
large ones. A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of
diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled
dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful
diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness
prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often
necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To
address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes
representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real
data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as
guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the
representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive
experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets,
demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating
high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture
generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between
diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a
practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled
dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPNNs suffer from oversmoothing and oversquashing issues. Existing global approaches are suboptimal as they may help some regions but harm others. The authors found that increasing spectral gap Œª causes gradient vanishing, undermining message passing effectiveness.

Method: Proposed a local approach using Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, established nonhomogeneous boundary conditions based on Robin condition, and designed GBN network with local bottleneck adjustment to adaptively adjust message passing based on local structures.

Result: Extensive experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show GBN's expressiveness. GBN maintains performance without degradation even with 256+ layers, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing both oversmoothing and oversquashing.

Conclusion: The local approach using Riemannian geometry and Robin boundary conditions effectively addresses fundamental limitations of MPNNs, enabling deep graph networks while maintaining performance across various graph types.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) is the building block of graph
foundation models, but fundamentally suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing. There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both
issues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be
beneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the
suboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing
through a global measure -- spectral gap $\lambda$ -- and prove that the
increase of $\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input
features, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated
by such theoretical insights, we propose a \textbf{local} approach that
adaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this,
we connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel
nonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with
local bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive
experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of
GBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the
network depth exceeds $256$ layers.

TL;DR: Applying explainable AI techniques (Grad-CAM and SHAP) to interpret PhaseNet's seismic event detection decisions, leading to improved model reliability and performance through a SHAP-gated inference scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks like PhaseNet achieve high accuracy but their black-box nature raises concerns for critical applications, requiring interpretability and enhanced reliability.

Method: Used Grad-CAM to visualize network attention and SHAP to quantify feature contributions, then developed a SHAP-gated inference scheme combining model outputs with explanation-based metrics.

Result: SHAP-gated model achieved F1-score of 0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97) on 9,000 test waveforms, outperforming baseline PhaseNet (F1-score 0.97) with enhanced noise robustness.

Conclusion: XAI techniques can both interpret deep learning models and directly enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated seismic detectors.

Abstract: Deep neural networks like PhaseNet show high accuracy in detecting
microseismic events, but their black-box nature is a concern in critical
applications. We apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive
Explanations (SHAP), to interpret the PhaseNet model's decisions and improve
its reliability. Grad-CAM highlights that the network's attention aligns with
P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming
that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal
components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that
combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors.
On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of
0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet
(F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. These results
show that XAI can not only interpret deep learning models but also directly
enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated
seismic detectors.

*Jing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers develop modular, interpretable mechanisms for compositional reasoning through progressive layer specialization during training, enabling systematic generalization across different conditions including out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers achieve compositional reasoning on unseen sequences through in-context learning and skill composition, particularly investigating the mechanisms behind their generalization capabilities.

Method: Used the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM) - a probabilistic context-free grammar generating sequences via recursive rules. Trained models on sequence subsets and evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with same rules, and cross-layer transfer.

Result: Performance improved systematically with task complexity and number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution tasks requiring significantly more examples. Progressive emergence of layer specialization during training correlated with generalization performance. Transformers developed structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized layers.

Conclusion: Transformers develop modular, interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, with internal algorithmic structure directly linked to observed behavioral capabilities through hierarchical representation organization.

Abstract: Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during
training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill
composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model
(RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through
recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and
evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution
generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and
cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with
task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution
tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios.
Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization
during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal
component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers
develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized
layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular,
interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal
algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAMSDAN is a distribution-aware multi-source domain adaptation network that addresses cross-domain EEG emotion recognition challenges by dynamically modeling domain heterogeneity and achieving fine-grained semantic alignment through prototype-based constraints and adversarial learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Significant inter-individual variability limits generalization of EEG-based emotion recognition in cross-domain settings, requiring solutions for multi-source adaptation challenges including dynamic modeling of distributional heterogeneity and achieving fine-grained semantic consistency.

Method: Integrates prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning, uses domain-aware source weighting based on MMD to dynamically estimate inter-domain shifts, and employs prototype-guided conditional alignment with dual pseudo-label interaction for enhanced pseudo-label reliability and category-level alignment.

Result: Achieved average accuracies of 94.86% and 79.78% on SEED and SEED-IV for cross-subject protocols, 95.12% and 83.15% for cross-session protocols, and 82.88% on FACED dataset for cross-subject recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed DAMSDAN framework effectively addresses cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition challenges through dynamic domain modeling and fine-grained semantic alignment, with extensive experiments validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of
EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core
challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional
heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to
reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency
to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware
multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates
prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder
toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware
source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically
estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition,
a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label
interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level,
fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift.
Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\%
for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the
large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive
ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.

### [204] [Towards geological inference with process-based and deep generative modeling, part 2: inversion of fluvial deposits and latent-space disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17478)
*Guillaume Rongier,Luk Peeters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GANs can be used for subsurface modeling but struggle with inversion due to entangled latent spaces. Fine-tuning helps but depends on initial inversion success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and uncertainties in subsurface decision-making make scalable data acquisition difficult. Embedding geological knowledge into predictive models offers a cost-effective alternative.

Method: Used generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained to produce fluvial deposits, then inverted them to match well and seismic data. Tested four inversion approaches on samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells.

Result: Inversion struggled to match well data, especially with more wells or when test samples diverged from training data. Fine-tuning GANs to restructure latent space locally reduced mismatches to acceptable levels.

Conclusion: GANs can handle tasks for geomodeling workflows but need further assessment of robustness and better integration with geological interpretation.

Abstract: High costs and uncertainties make subsurface decision-making challenging, as
acquiring new data is rarely scalable. Embedding geological knowledge directly
into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables
just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train
generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning
algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be
inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to
three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,
especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the
training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it
is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not
necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent
overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during
training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning
the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to
acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this
approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which
influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can
already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling
workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best
leverage them in support of geological interpretation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that matrix factorization-based DP accounting methods from centralized learning can be generalized to decentralized learning, enabling tighter privacy bounds and better privacy-utility trade-offs. It introduces MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based algorithm with correlated noise that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized learning enables collaborative training without sharing raw data, but current DP accounting methods for DL show worse privacy-utility trade-offs than centralized training. The authors aim to leverage recent advances in centralized DP accounting to improve privacy analysis in decentralized settings.

Method: The authors generalize matrix factorization (MF) results from centralized DP accounting to decentralized learning, creating a unified formulation that covers standard DL algorithms and trust models. They introduce MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise.

Result: The approach yields tighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a principled way to develop new ones. MAFALDA-SGD outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world graphs.

Conclusion: Matrix factorization-based DP accounting can be successfully applied to decentralized learning, enabling better privacy-utility trade-offs and more effective algorithm design in peer-to-peer collaborative training settings.

Abstract: Decentralized Learning (DL) enables users to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data by iteratively averaging local updates with neighbors
in a network graph. This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability
and its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy
guarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with
results showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across
peer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility
trade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to
limitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show
that recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization
(MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By
generalizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL
algorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields
tighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a
principled way to develop new ones. To demonstrate the approach, we introduce
MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise that
outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a methodology for analyzing neural networks using layer-wise Hessian matrices to study local parameter space geometry and reveals connections between Hessian spectral properties and network performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a formal tool for characterizing the local geometry of neural network parameter spaces and understand how this geometry relates to network behavior, generalization, and training dynamics.

Method: The authors define local Hessian matrices for each functional layer as second derivatives of a scalar function with respect to layer parameters, then analyze spectral properties (eigenvalue distributions) across 111 experiments on 37 datasets.

Result: The study reveals consistent structural patterns in local Hessian evolution during training and shows correlations between Hessian spectra and generalization performance, identifying quantitative patterns for overfitting, underparameterization, and expressivity.

Conclusion: Local geometric analysis through Hessian matrices provides a foundation for diagnosing and designing deep neural networks, connecting optimization geometry with functional behavior to improve architectures and training stability.

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for analyzing neural networks through the lens of
layer-wise Hessian matrices. The local Hessian of each functional block (layer)
is defined as the matrix of second derivatives of a scalar function with
respect to the parameters of that layer. This concept provides a formal tool
for characterizing the local geometry of the parameter space. We show that the
spectral properties of local Hessians, such as the distribution of eigenvalues,
reveal quantitative patterns associated with overfitting,
underparameterization, and expressivity in neural network architectures. We
conduct an extensive empirical study involving 111 experiments across 37
datasets. The results demonstrate consistent structural regularities in the
evolution of local Hessians during training and highlight correlations between
their spectra and generalization performance. These findings establish a
foundation for using local geometric analysis to guide the diagnosis and design
of deep neural networks. The proposed framework connects optimization geometry
with functional behavior and offers practical insight for improving network
architectures and training stability.

Motivation: To address limitations in current reasoning benchmarks by creating a more challenging test that evaluates how well models handle increased complexity, wider attribute ranges, and reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: Extends I-RAVEN benchmark by increasing operand complexity, expanding attribute ranges, and introducing perceptual uncertainty to create more challenging reasoning tasks.

Result: LRMs outperform LLMs on longer reasoning relations (improved productivity) and wider attribute ranges (better systematicity), but both struggle significantly with reasoning under uncertainty and exploring multiple probabilistic outcomes.

Conclusion: While LRMs show improvements over LLMs in certain aspects of reasoning, current models still face fundamental challenges in handling uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning, indicating important directions for future research.

Abstract: We introduce I-RAVEN-X, a symbolic benchmark designed to evaluate
generalization and robustness in analogical and mathematical reasoning for
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). I-RAVEN-X
extends I-RAVEN by increasing operand complexity, attribute range, and
introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show
that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning
relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still
significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively
explore multiple probabilistic outcomes.

*Lachlan Ewen MacDonald,Hancheng Min,Leandro Palma,Salma Tarmoun,Ziqing Xu,Ren√© Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes gradient descent with large learning rates in overparametrized least squares, showing how different learning rate regimes affect convergence to flat minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why gradient descent on neural networks works well with large learning rates (edge of stability regime) despite non-monotonic objective decrease and implicit bias toward flat minima.

Method: Analyzes GD dynamics in overparametrized least squares by decomposing the dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to the manifold of global minimizers, treating the orthogonal component as a bifurcating dynamical system.

Result: Identifies three convergence regimes: subcritical (transient instability, linear convergence to suboptimal flat minimum), critical (persistent instability with power-law convergence to optimal flat minimum), and supercritical (persistent instability with linear convergence to period-2 orbit around optimal flat minimum).

Conclusion: The analysis provides theoretical quantification of gradient descent behavior with large learning rates, explaining the implicit bias toward flat minima through the geometric structure of the optimization landscape in overparametrized settings.

Abstract: Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for
gradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable", regime.
In contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a
large step size regime called the ``edge of stability", in which the objective
decreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima.
In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing
convergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an
overparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is
that, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers
forms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD
dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component
corresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while
the orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows
us to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning
rate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is
overcome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global
minimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time
with a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c)
the supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with
linear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat
global minimum.

TL;DR: Proposes a graphon-based theoretical framework to analyze sparse neural networks, showing that pruning methods converge to specific graphons in infinite width, and introduces Graphon NTK to study training dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why some sparse neural network structures are more trainable than others with the same sparsity level, and develop a systematic approach to analyze connectivity patterns in sparse networks.

Method: Uses graph theory and graphons to characterize sparse neural networks in infinite-width regime, proposes Graphon Limit Hypothesis, and derives Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to study training dynamics.

Result: Empirical evidence supports Graphon Limit Hypothesis, and spectral analysis of Graphon NTK correlates with observed training dynamics, explaining varying convergence behaviors of different pruning methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides theoretical insights into how connectivity patterns impact trainability of sparse network architectures and offers a general approach for analyzing sparse networks.

Abstract: Sparse neural networks promise efficiency, yet training them effectively
remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that
create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are
better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly
understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental
problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph
limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the
infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse
neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as
networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of
different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and
provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon
representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to
study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit.
Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse
networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK
correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the
varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework
provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the
trainability of various sparse network architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE-D is a framework that detects Parkinson's disease-related driving anomalies by analyzing motor impairments and using an attention-based network to prioritize spatiotemporal features from vehicle control data, achieving 96.8% accuracy in distinguishing affected driving patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver health state affects driving behavior, with pathological conditions like Parkinson's disease causing subtle deviations that pose safety risks. Previous research focused on temporary anomalies like drowsiness, but limited work addresses chronic medical conditions' impact on driving.

Method: Analyzed Parkinson's disease symptomatology and motor impairments, established causal links to driving performance degradation. Built behavioral profiles from multiple vehicle control components. Designed attention-based network to prioritize spatiotemporal features for robust anomaly detection under physiological variability.

Result: Validated on Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator using three road maps. Achieved 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal and Parkinson-affected driving patterns.

Conclusion: SAFE-D successfully bridges the gap in detecting pathologically-triggered driving deviations, providing an effective framework for enhancing driving safety in Parkinson's disease patients through robust behavioral anomaly detection.

Abstract: A driver's health state serves as a determinant factor in driving behavioral
regulation. Subtle deviations from normalcy can lead to operational anomalies,
posing risks to public transportation safety. While prior efforts have
developed detection mechanisms for functionally-driven temporary anomalies such
as drowsiness and distraction, limited research has addressed
pathologically-triggered deviations, especially those stemming from chronic
medical conditions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the driving behavior of
Parkinson's disease patients and propose SAFE-D, a novel framework for
detecting Parkinson-related behavioral anomalies to enhance driving safety. Our
methodology starts by performing analysis of Parkinson's disease
symptomatology, focusing on primary motor impairments, and establishes causal
links to degraded driving performance. To represent the subclinical behavioral
variations of early-stage Parkinson's disease, our framework integrates data
from multiple vehicle control components to build a behavioral profile. We then
design an attention-based network that adaptively prioritizes spatiotemporal
features, enabling robust anomaly detection under physiological variability.
Finally, we validate SAFE-D on the Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator,
using data from three road maps to emulate real-world driving. Our results show
SAFE-D achieves 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal and
Parkinson-affected driving patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CD-GTMLL addresses long-tail imbalance in multi-label learning by framing it as a cooperative potential game where players share global accuracy but earn curiosity rewards for rare labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on tail-aware metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tail imbalance is endemic in multi-label learning where few head labels dominate gradient signals while many rare labels are ignored, limiting practical effectiveness.

Method: Casts multi-label learning as a cooperative potential game where label space is split among cooperating players who share global accuracy payoff and earn additional curiosity rewards based on label rarity and inter-player disagreement.

Result: Achieves consistent state-of-the-art gains with up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over strongest baselines on conventional benchmarks and extreme-scale datasets, showing emergent division of labor and faster consensus on rare classes.

Conclusion: CD-GTMLL offers a principled, scalable route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction without hand-tuned class weights, converging to tail-aware stationary points that tighten lower bounds on expected Rare-F1.

Abstract: Long-tail imbalance is endemic to multi-label learning: a few head labels
dominate the gradient signal, while the many rare labels that matter in
practice are silently ignored. We tackle this problem by casting the task as a
cooperative potential game. In our Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label
Learning (CD-GTMLL) framework, the label space is split among several
cooperating players that share a global accuracy payoff yet earn additional
curiosity rewards that rise with label rarity and inter-player disagreement.
These curiosity bonuses inject gradient on under-represented tags without
hand-tuned class weights. We prove that gradient best-response updates ascend a
differentiable potential and converge to tail-aware stationary points that
tighten a lower bound on the expected Rare-F1. Extensive experiments on
conventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets show consistent
state-of-the-art gains, delivering up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over the
strongest baselines, while ablations reveal emergent division of labour and
faster consensus on rare classes. CD-GTMLL thus offers a principled, scalable
route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction.

TL;DR: CFKD is a counterfactual knowledge distillation framework that addresses spurious correlations in deep learning models without requiring group labels, by generating diverse counterfactuals and using knowledge distillation to correct decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are vulnerable to spurious correlations (Clever Hans predictors), and existing group distributional robustness methods like DFR have limitations: group labels are often unavailable, low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage, and performance degrades with multiple spurious correlations.

Method: Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD) generates diverse counterfactuals that enable human annotators to efficiently explore and correct model decision boundaries through knowledge distillation. Unlike DFR, it enriches undersampled groups with new data points rather than just reweighting them.

Result: CFKD achieves effective scaling to multiple confounders, yields balanced generalization across groups, and shows strong gains in low-data regimes with pronounced spurious correlations across five datasets from synthetic tasks to industrial applications.

Conclusion: CFKD provides a robust framework that sidesteps the limitations of group label-dependent methods, works without confounder labels, and demonstrates superior performance particularly in challenging low-data scenarios with multiple spurious correlations.

Abstract: Deep learning models remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, leading to
so-called Clever Hans predictors that undermine robustness even in large-scale
foundation and self-supervised models. Group distributional robustness methods,
such as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to
upweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels
are often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the
subgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple
spurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups. We propose
Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD), a framework that sidesteps these
issues by generating diverse counterfactuals, enabling a human annotator to
efficiently explore and correct the model's decision boundaries through a
knowledge distillation step. Unlike DFR, our method not only reweights the
undersampled groups, but it also enriches them with new data points. Our method
does not require any confounder labels, achieves effective scaling to multiple
confounders, and yields balanced generalization across groups. We demonstrate

### [213] [How Does Label Noise Gradient Descent Improve Generalization in the Low SNR Regime?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17526)
*Wei Huang,Andi Han,Yujin Song,Yilan Chen,Denny Wu,Difan Zou,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adding label noise during gradient descent training suppresses noise memorization and improves generalization in low signal-to-noise ratio settings, while standard gradient descent tends to overfit to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often overfit to noise in training data, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios, which harms generalization. Prior observations suggest label noise can provide implicit regularization.

Method: Training a two-layer neural network with label noise gradient descent in an idealized signal-noise data setting, where label noise is introduced during gradient updates.

Result: Label noise GD suppresses noise memorization, allowing rapid signal growth while controlling overfitting, achieving good generalization. Standard GD tends to overfit to noise with non-vanishing test error in low SNR settings.

Conclusion: Introducing label noise during gradient-based training provides benefits by preventing noise memorization and improving generalization performance in low SNR regimes.

Abstract: The capacity of deep learning models is often large enough to both learn the
underlying statistical signal and overfit to noise in the training set. This
noise memorization can be harmful especially for data with a low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to poor generalization. Inspired by prior
observations that label noise provides implicit regularization that improves
generalization, in this work, we investigate whether introducing label noise to
the gradient updates can enhance the test performance of neural network (NN) in
the low SNR regime. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer NN with a
simple label noise gradient descent (GD) algorithm, in an idealized
signal-noise data setting. We prove that adding label noise during training
suppresses noise memorization, preventing it from dominating the learning
process; consequently, label noise GD enjoys rapid signal growth while the
overfitting remains controlled, thereby achieving good generalization despite
the low SNR. In contrast, we also show that NN trained with standard GD tends
to overfit to noise in the same low SNR setting and establish a non-vanishing
lower bound on its test error, thus demonstrating the benefit of introducing
label noise in gradient-based training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajMamba is a novel approach for efficient vehicle trajectory learning that addresses computational burdens from textual data and redundant points by using a Traj-Mamba Encoder, Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training, and Knowledge Distillation Pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in learning travel semantics from vehicle GPS trajectories, including the computational burden from textual road/POI information and the negative impact of redundant trajectory points on efficiency and embedding quality.

Method: Uses a Traj-Mamba Encoder to capture movement patterns from both GPS and road perspectives, incorporates Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training to embed travel purposes without extra overhead, and employs Knowledge Distillation Pre-training with a learnable mask generator to identify key points and compress trajectories.

Result: Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks demonstrate that TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: TrajMamba provides an effective and efficient solution for learning semantically rich vehicle trajectory embeddings by addressing key challenges in computational burden and trajectory redundancy.

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories record how vehicles move over time, storing valuable
travel semantics, including movement patterns and travel purposes. Learning
travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world
applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges.
First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and
points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in
textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to
modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which
harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address
these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and
semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a
Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS
and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of
continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware
Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings
without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce
redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation
Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask
generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that
TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and
accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses inconsistencies in time-series anomaly detection evaluation by introducing verifiable properties for principled metric assessment, showing most existing metrics fail key properties, and proposing LARM/ALARM metrics that satisfy all requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection metrics are unreliable and yield misleading results, which can lead to catastrophic failures in safety-critical systems. There's a need for principled evaluation frameworks to ensure reliable comparisons.

Method: Introduce verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. Analyze 37 widely used metrics against these properties and propose LARM (and its advanced variant ALARM) as new metrics that provably satisfy all properties.

Result: Most existing metrics satisfy only a few properties, and none satisfy all properties, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior evaluation results. LARM and ALARM are shown to provably satisfy all required properties.

Conclusion: The proposed properties provide a theoretical foundation for reliable anomaly detection evaluation, and LARM/ALARM metrics close the gap in existing evaluation methods by satisfying all essential requirements.

Abstract: Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in
safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid
outages. Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance
remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task
and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing
verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating
time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework
that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37
widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none
satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close
this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all
properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter
requirements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the robustness and stability of automated Lagrange multiplier updates in safe reinforcement learning, showing that while automated updates can recover optimal performance, they exhibit oscillatory behavior that can be mitigated with PID-controlled updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of empirical evidence on the robustness of automated Lagrange multiplier updates in safe RL and understand how the choice of Œª affects the trade-off between performance and constraint satisfaction.

Method: Analysis of optimality and stability of Lagrange multipliers across various tasks using Œª-profiles for visualization, and investigation of automated multiplier updates and PID-controlled updates.

Result: Œª-profiles reveal high sensitivity of Œª values and lack of general intuition for choosing optimal Œª*. Automated updates can recover or exceed optimal performance but exhibit oscillatory behavior. PID-controlled updates can mitigate oscillations but require careful tuning.

Conclusion: Automated Lagrange multiplier updates are effective but unstable, highlighting the need for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems,
constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be
carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning
provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being
a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially
depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the
trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update
the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in
practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an
automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we
analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe
reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles
that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and
constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly
sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general
intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally
show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even
exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference
in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier
updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated
through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to
achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need
for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement
learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at

*Jyler Menard,R. A. Mansbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates using dimensionality reduction and physicochemical property organization to improve variational autoencoders for antimicrobial peptide design, focusing on interpretability and optimization efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models like variational autoencoders are effective for peptide design but lack interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a search space.

Method: The study investigates three aspects: (1) further compression of design space via dimensionality reduction, (2) interpretability of spaces, and (3) organizing latent spaces with physicochemical properties to improve antimicrobial activity optimization.

Result: Findings show that further reduction of latent space via dimensionality reduction is advantageous when organizing with relevant information, dimensionality reduction search spaces are more interpretable, and latent spaces can be organized with different physicochemical properties even with limited label availability.

Conclusion: Dimensionality reduction and physicochemical property organization can enhance the interpretability and optimization efficiency of latent spaces in antimicrobial peptide design using variational autoencoders.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of therapeutics to treat
bacterial infections. Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult
because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep
generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in
peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a
continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to
great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of
interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a
search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design
space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the
interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with
physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing
antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via
dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with
more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality
reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the
latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different
percentages of available labels.

TL;DR: CEPerFed is a communication-efficient personalized federated learning method for multi-pulse MRI classification that addresses data heterogeneity using historical gradients and reduces communication overhead via hierarchical SVD compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust multi-pulse MRI classification for clinical applications like Alzheimer's disease diagnosis while preserving privacy by avoiding raw data sharing across medical institutions, overcoming federated learning challenges of data heterogeneity and high communication costs.

Method: CEPerFed incorporates client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to coordinate local and global optimization, using hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy to transmit only critical information for model updates.

Result: Experiments on five classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method in handling data heterogeneity and reducing communication overhead.

Conclusion: CEPerFed successfully addresses both data heterogeneity and communication efficiency challenges in federated learning for medical imaging, providing a practical solution for privacy-preserving multi-pulse MRI classification.

Abstract: Multi-pulse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized for clinical
practice such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To train a robust model for
multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various
medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing
across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to
address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect
of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large
numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these
challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL
method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating
client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to
coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the
contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,
while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global
optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data
distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a
hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical
information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be
released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZACH-ViT is a compact 0.25M-parameter Vision Transformer that removes positional embeddings and CLS token for permutation invariance, achieving superior performance in classifying cardiogenic pulmonary edema from non-cardiogenic patterns in lung ultrasound videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary edema from non-cardiogenic patterns in lung ultrasound videos is challenging due to high visual variability and overlapping artifacts, which complicates automated classification.

Method: Proposed ZACH-ViT with zero positional embeddings and CLS token for full permutation invariance, plus ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation that permutes probe-view sequences while preserving anatomical validity.

Result: Achieved highest validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60) and specificity (0.91), outperforming 9 state-of-the-art baselines that collapsed to trivial classification. Trains 1.35x faster with 2.5x fewer parameters than Minimal ViT.

Conclusion: Aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform scale in small-data medical imaging, supporting real-time clinical deployment.

Abstract: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and
structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging
due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns
(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This
heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and
pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive
Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer
variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it
fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To
enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),
which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving
anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95
critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the
heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest
validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)
and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial
classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with
2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results
show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform
scale in small-data medical imaging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses suicide prediction using machine learning and deep learning techniques, particularly GANs for data augmentation to handle extreme class imbalance in a dataset with only 4 positive cases out of 656 samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide prediction is crucial for prevention, but real-world data suffers from extreme class imbalance with very few positive cases, making effective modeling challenging.

Method: Used machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) and deep learning techniques including Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate synthetic data samples for dataset enhancement and address class imbalance.

Result: Logistic Regression achieved weighted precision 0.99, recall 0.85, F1 0.91; Random Forest showed 0.98, 0.99, 0.99; SVM achieved 0.99, 0.76, 0.86. LR and SVM correctly identified suicide attempts (sensitivity:1.0) but had some false positives, while RF had perfect specificity but zero sensitivity.

Conclusion: The models demonstrated effectiveness in suicide prediction, with GAN playing a crucial role in generating synthetic data to support modeling efforts for suicide prevention.

Abstract: Suicide prediction is the key for prevention, but real data with sufficient
positive samples is rare and causes extreme class imbalance. We utilized
machine learning (ML) to build the model and deep learning (DL) techniques,
like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to generate synthetic data samples
to enhance the dataset. The initial dataset contained 656 samples, with only
four positive cases, prompting the need for data augmentation. A variety of
machine learning models, ranging from interpretable data models to black box
algorithmic models, were used. On real test data, Logistic Regression (LR)
achieved a weighted precision of 0.99, a weighted recall of 0.85, and a
weighted F1 score of 0.91; Random Forest (RF) showed 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99,
respectively; and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 0.99, 0.76, and 0.86.
LR and SVM correctly identified one suicide attempt case (sensitivity:1.0) and
misclassified LR(20) and SVM (31) non-attempts as attempts (specificity: 0.85 &
0.76, respectively). RF identified 0 suicide attempt cases (sensitivity: 0.0)
with 0 false positives (specificity: 1.0). These results highlight the models'
effectiveness, with GAN playing a key role in generating synthetic data to
support suicide prevention modeling efforts.

TL;DR: A cascaded approach combining open-vocabulary object detection with lightweight few-shot learning for remote sensing applications, using FLAME active learning for efficient sample selection and real-time adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary object detection models struggle with fine-grained class distinctions in specialized domains like remote sensing due to natural language ambiguity, limiting practical applications such as illegal fishing monitoring.

Method: Cascaded framework that first uses zero-shot OVD for high-recall proposals, then refines with a compact classifier trained on few user-annotated examples using FLAME active learning strategy for sample selection.

Result: Consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on remote sensing benchmarks, enables instant adaptation within less than a minute, and achieves high accuracy without costly full-model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Establishes a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting foundation models to specific user needs in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by
detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot
performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often
compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical
downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish
between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their
embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user
goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.
To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad
generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot
classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate
high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high
precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of
user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery
annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning
strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME
identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision
boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample
diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without
costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then
a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our
method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,
establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting
foundation models to specific user needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feedback is essential for translating complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization objectives, but existing methods have limited feedback formats and require domain-specific customization.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach using LLMs to convert unstructured natural language feedback into scalar utilities, which are then used for Bayesian Optimization over numeric search spaces. This allows flexible user priors without manual kernel design.

Result: The method outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in feedback-limited regimes, while providing a more natural interface for decision makers.

Conclusion: The language-in-the-loop framework successfully combines the flexibility of LLMs for feedback interpretation with the sample efficiency and principled uncertainty quantification of Bayesian Optimization.

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating
complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization
objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large
language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural
language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space.
Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and
requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach
leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility
signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel
design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and
principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method
not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also
outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in
feedback-limited regimes.

Motivation: The research aims to bridge the gap between policy gradient methods and dynamic programming in multi-model MDPs (MMDPs), and to develop rigorous algorithms for risk-averse reinforcement learning objectives like ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.

Method: Developed CADP algorithm using coordinate ascent with dynamic programming, established contraction conditions for ERM Bellman operators, and proposed model-free Q-learning algorithms with monotonicity-based convergence proofs for risk-averse objectives.

Result: Proved existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC/EVaR-TRC, demonstrated monotone policy improvements with CADP, and established convergence guarantees for Q-learning algorithms in risk-averse settings.

Conclusion: The dissertation successfully connects policy gradient and dynamic programming approaches, provides comprehensive theoretical foundations for risk-averse RL, and delivers practical algorithms with proven convergence properties for complex risk-sensitive decision-making problems.

Abstract: This dissertation makes three main contributions. First, We identify a new
connection between policy gradient and dynamic programming in MMDPs and propose
the Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP) algorithm to compute a Markov
policy that maximizes the discounted return averaged over the uncertain models.
CADP adjusts model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy
improvements to a local maximum. Second, We establish sufficient and necessary
conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and
prove the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC
and EVaR-TRC. We also propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration,
and linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies for
ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. Third, We propose model-free Q-learning algorithms for
computing policies with risk-averse objectives: ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. The
challenge is that Q-learning ERM Bellman may not be a contraction. Instead, we
use the monotonicity of Q-learning ERM Bellman operators to derive a rigorous
proof that the ERM-TRC and the EVaR-TRC Q-learning algorithms converge to the
optimal risk-averse value functions. The proposed Q-learning algorithms compute
the optimal stationary policy for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bi-level RL framework to close the Sim2Real performance gap by directly adapting simulator parameters based on real-world performance, rather than using proxy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Sim2Real RL methods use simulator accuracy and variability as proxies for real-world performance, but these metrics don't necessarily correlate with actual policy performance in the real world, leading to significant performance drops when transferring from simulation to reality.

Method: A bi-level RL framework where the inner-level RL trains policies purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts simulation model and reward parameters to maximize real-world performance of the in-sim trained policies.

Result: The authors derive and validate mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that can effectively close the Sim2Real performance gap in simple examples.

Conclusion: The proposed bi-level RL approach directly optimizes simulator parameters based on real-world performance, providing a more effective solution to the Sim2Real transfer problem compared to methods that rely on proxy metrics.

Abstract: Sim2Real aims at training policies in high-fidelity simulation environments
and effectively transferring them to the real world. Despite the developments
of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely
in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real
environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current
Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies
for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate
with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and
empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this
issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world
performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level
RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the
simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world
performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the
mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the
Sim2Real performance gap.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitation of black-box LLMs in fine-grained decision making due to low numerical output cardinality. It proposes efficient methods to increase operational granularity without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box LLMs have limited control over operating points for applications requiring specific metric constraints (e.g., precision ‚â•95%), preventing fine-grained adjustment of decision making behavior.

Method: The authors investigate reasons for low-cardinality outputs, experiment with existing techniques (prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation, confidence elicitation), and propose new efficient approaches to increase operating point diversity.

Result: The proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable or better performance than benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

Conclusion: Efficient methods can significantly improve the operational granularity of black-box LLMs as classifiers without sacrificing performance or increasing inference costs.

Abstract: Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible
alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled
data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision
making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints
on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with
black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output
cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points,
preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this
paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently
improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically,
we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs
and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative
verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering,
uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that
they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing
performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient
approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available
operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating
points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark
methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

### [227] [Prediction of Sea Ice Velocity and Concentration in the Arctic Ocean using Physics-informed Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17756)
*Younghyun Koo,Maryam Rahnemoonfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) improve sea ice velocity and concentration predictions by integrating physical knowledge into machine learning models, outperforming purely data-driven approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data-driven ML models for sea ice prediction have limitations in generalizability and physical consistency, especially as Arctic sea ice conditions change rapidly with thinner ice and accelerated melting.

Method: Developed PINN strategies using Hierarchical Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, incorporating physics loss function and activation function to ensure physically plausible outputs for sea ice velocity and concentration.

Result: The PINN model outperformed fully data-driven models in daily predictions of sea ice velocity and concentration, even with small training datasets, with particular improvements in melting/early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

Conclusion: Physics-informed neural networks provide more robust and physically consistent sea ice predictions compared to purely data-driven approaches, especially under changing Arctic conditions.

Abstract: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the
Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely
used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC).
However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and
physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and
quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase
with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML
model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the
dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we
develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical
knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical
Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics
loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV
and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the
daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of
samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and
early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

*Ryan A. Robinett,Sophia A. Madejski,Kyle Ruark,Samantha J. Riesenfeld,Lorenzo Orecchia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a proof-of-concept for atlas-based manifold learning methods that directly learn differentiable atlases from point cloud data, enabling Riemannian optimization on the latent manifold with improved efficiency, accuracy, interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manifold learning methods primarily focus on dimensionality reduction into Euclidean space, losing key manifold features when embedding dimension approaches the intrinsic dimension. Directly learning the latent manifold as a differentiable atlas has been relatively underexplored despite the popularity of the manifold hypothesis.

Method: Implemented a generic data structure to maintain a differentiable atlas enabling Riemannian optimization over the manifold, complemented by an unsupervised heuristic that learns a differentiable atlas from point cloud data.

Result: Experimental demonstration shows advantages in efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. In supervised classification over the Klein bottle and RNA velocity analysis of hematopoietic data, the approach shows improved interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: Atlas-based methods provide an effective alternative to traditional manifold learning approaches, offering direct optimization on the latent manifold with practical benefits in real-world applications.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the manifold hypothesis, current manifold-learning
methods do not support machine learning directly on the latent $d$-dimensional
data manifold, as they primarily aim to perform dimensionality reduction into
$\mathbb{R}^D$, losing key manifold features when the embedding dimension $D$
approaches $d$.
  On the other hand, methods that directly learn the latent manifold as a
differentiable atlas have been relatively underexplored.
  In this paper, we aim to give a proof of concept of the effectiveness and
potential of atlas-based methods. To this end, we implement a generic data
structure to maintain a differentiable atlas that enables Riemannian
optimization over the manifold. We complement this with an unsupervised
heuristic that learns a differentiable atlas from point cloud data. We
experimentally demonstrate that this approach has advantages in terms of
efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. Moreover, in a supervised
classification task over the Klein bottle and in RNA velocity analysis of
hematopoietic data, we showcase the improved interpretability and robustness of
our approach.

### [229] [Mapping Post-Training Forgetting in Language Models at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17776)
*Jackson Harmon,Andreas Hochlehnert,Matthias Bethge,Ameya Prabhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sample-wise framework to measure knowledge forgetting and backward transfer during post-training of language models, revealing that different post-training stages have varying effects on pretrained knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how scaled post-training affects pretrained knowledge in language models, since traditional task averages obscure individual knowledge changes and not all forgetting is equal.

Method: A sample-wise paradigm that counts 1->0 transitions (forgetting) and 0->1 transitions (backward transfer), with chance-adjusted variants for multiple-choice benchmarks to subtract random guessing effects.

Result: Domain-continual pretraining causes moderate forgetting with low-to-moderate backward transfer; RL/SFT post-training yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on math/logic with low-to-moderate forgetting; effects vary with data scale and model merging doesn't reliably mitigate forgetting.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical way to map how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale, enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in
language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly
understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.
president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence,
we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when
backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before
post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to
quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects
and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add
chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random
guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across
post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis
shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with
low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base
models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on
math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to
instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both
forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed
and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not
reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical
yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --
enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

### [230] [Inference-Time Compute Scaling For Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17786)
*Adam Stecklov,Noah El Rimawi-Fine,Mathieu Blanchette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel inference-time scaling procedures for Flow Matching that preserve the linear interpolant during sampling, improving sample quality in image generation and demonstrating for the first time its application to unconditional protein generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time compute scaling has improved sample quality in other models but remains under-explored for Flow Matching, with existing approaches sacrificing FM's efficient sampling by using non-linear interpolants.

Method: The authors developed inference-time scaling procedures for Flow Matching that maintain the linear interpolant during sampling, preserving FM's efficient and straight sampling characteristics.

Result: Evaluations show that sample quality consistently improves as inference compute increases, and the method successfully applies to both image generation and (for the first time) unconditional protein generation.

Conclusion: Flow matching inference-time scaling can be effectively applied to scientific domains while preserving the method's computational efficiency, opening new possibilities for high-quality sample generation in various applications.

Abstract: Allocating extra computation at inference time has recently improved sample
quality in large language models and diffusion-based image generation. In
parallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and
scientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain
under-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but
replace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP)
interpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling.
Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been
applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel
inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant
during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the
first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation,
show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute
increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to
scientific domains.

### [231] [Unbiased Gradient Low-Rank Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17802)
*Rui Pan,Yang Luo,Yuxing Liu,Yang You,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM) is a novel memory-efficient optimization method for large language models that combines GaLore's low-rank projection with Muon's layerwise sampling to eliminate bias and provide convergence guarantees while maintaining memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient low-rank projection methods like GaLore lack convergence guarantees due to inherent biases introduced by low-rank projections, creating performance gaps compared to full-parameter training. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: GUM combines GaLore's low-rank projection mechanism with the Muon algorithm's layerwise sampling technique to debias the low-rank projection process, creating an unbiased optimization method.

Result: Theoretical analysis proves GUM matches Muon's convergence guarantees while preserving memory efficiency. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and pretraining show improvements over GaLore and even better performance than full-parameter training.

Conclusion: GUM successfully addresses the bias problem in low-rank optimization methods, providing convergence guarantees and improved performance through more uniform knowledge distribution across layers and better parameter space utilization.

Abstract: Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large
language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank
projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a
representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is
their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches
introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,
which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.
Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling
technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an
instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank
optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named
GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the
convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory
efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and
pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even
better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows
that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution
of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model
parameter space and better memorization.

based on a pivoted Cholesky factorization, facilitating scalability to large
datasets. Empirical tests suggest favorably of the proposed methodology.

### [233] [Learning density ratios in causal inference using Bregman-Riesz regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16127)
*Oliver J. Hines,Caleb H. Miles*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper unifies three different density ratio estimation methods (Bregman divergences, probabilistic classification, and Riesz loss minimization) into a common framework called Bregman-Riesz regression, and shows how data augmentation can be used to apply these methods to causal inference problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Density ratio estimation is fundamental in many statistical and machine learning applications, but existing methods are fragmented and naive approaches suffer from instability and the curse of dimensionality. The authors aim to unify different approaches and extend them to causal inference settings.

Method: The paper proposes Bregman-Riesz regression, which unifies three density ratio estimation approaches: (1) Bregman divergences, (2) probabilistic classification models, and (3) Riesz loss minimization. It also incorporates data augmentation techniques for causal inference applications where the numerator distribution represents unobserved interventions.

Result: The unified framework shows how different Bregman divergences and data augmentation strategies affect density ratio learning performance. The authors provide a Python package implementing Bregman-Riesz regression using gradient boosting, neural networks, and kernel methods.

Conclusion: Bregman-Riesz regression provides a unified framework for density ratio estimation that connects previously disparate methods and enables application to causal inference problems through data augmentation techniques.

Abstract: The ratio of two probability density functions is a fundamental quantity that
appears in many areas of statistics and machine learning, including causal
inference, reinforcement learning, covariate shift, outlier detection,
independence testing, importance sampling, and diffusion modeling. Naively
estimating the numerator and denominator densities separately using, e.g.,
kernel density estimators, can lead to unstable performance and suffers from
the curse of dimensionality as the number of covariates increases. For this
reason, several methods have been developed for estimating the density ratio
directly based on (a) Bregman divergences or (b) recasting the density ratio as
the odds in a probabilistic classification model that predicts whether an
observation is sampled from the numerator or denominator distribution.
Additionally, the density ratio can be viewed as the Riesz representer of a
continuous linear map, making it amenable to estimation via (c) minimization of
the so-called Riesz loss, which was developed to learn the Riesz representer in
the Riesz regression procedure in causal inference. In this paper we show that
all three of these methods can be unified in a common framework, which we call
Bregman-Riesz regression. We further show how data augmentation techniques can
be used to apply density ratio learning methods to causal problems, where the
numerator distribution typically represents an unobserved intervention. We show
through simulations how the choice of Bregman divergence and data augmentation
strategy can affect the performance of the resulting density ratio learner. A
Python package is provided for researchers to apply Bregman-Riesz regression in
practice using gradient boosting, neural networks, and kernel methods.

*Chenyu Zhang,Navid Azizan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Personalized Collaborative Learning (PCL) framework enables heterogeneous agents to learn personalized solutions while automatically adapting to unknown heterogeneity levels, achieving sample complexity reduction that interpolates between federated learning speedup and independent learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the fundamental tension between distributed collaboration and personalization in multi-agent learning, especially when dealing with unknown heterogeneity levels where agents need to gain collaborative speedup when similar without performance degradation when different.

Method: Proposed AffPCL method with carefully designed bias correction and importance correction mechanisms to robustly handle both environment and objective heterogeneity among agents.

Result: AffPCL reduces sample complexity over independent learning by a factor of max{n^{-1}, Œ¥}, where n is the number of agents and Œ¥‚àà[0,1] measures heterogeneity. The method automatically interpolates between linear speedup in homogeneous settings and independent learning baseline without requiring prior knowledge.

Conclusion: The framework enables agents to obtain linear speedup even when collaborating with arbitrarily dissimilar agents, revealing new insights into personalization and collaboration in high heterogeneity regimes.

Abstract: Multi-agent learning faces a fundamental tension: leveraging distributed
collaboration without sacrificing the personalization needed for diverse
agents. This tension intensifies when aiming for full personalization while
adapting to unknown heterogeneity levels -- gaining collaborative speedup when
agents are similar, without performance degradation when they are different.
Embracing the challenge, we propose personalized collaborative learning (PCL),
a novel framework for heterogeneous agents to collaboratively learn
personalized solutions with seamless adaptivity. Through carefully designed
bias correction and importance correction mechanisms, our method AffPCL
robustly handles both environment and objective heterogeneity. We prove that
AffPCL reduces sample complexity over independent learning by a factor of
$\max\{n^{-1}, \delta\}$, where $n$ is the number of agents and
$\delta\in[0,1]$ measures their heterogeneity. This affinity-based acceleration
automatically interpolates between the linear speedup of federated learning in
homogeneous settings and the baseline of independent learning, without
requiring prior knowledge of the system. Our analysis further reveals that an
agent may obtain linear speedup even by collaborating with arbitrarily
dissimilar agents, unveiling new insights into personalization and
collaboration in the high heterogeneity regime.

*Gitte Kremling,Francesco Iafrate,Mahsa Taheri,Johannes Lederer*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper establishes non-asymptotic convergence bounds for score-based generative modeling using probability flow ODEs under weak assumptions of weak log-concavity and Lipschitz continuity of the score function, accommodating non-log-concave distributions like Gaussian mixtures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing convergence guarantees for score-based generative modeling rely on restrictive regularity assumptions like strong log-concavity or bounded support, which limits applicability to realistic data distributions. This work aims to bridge this theoretical gap.

Method: The authors use probability flow ODEs with an exponential integrator scheme, explicitly accounting for initialization errors, score approximation errors, and discretization effects. They establish convergence bounds in the 2-Wasserstein distance.

Result: The paper provides non-asymptotic convergence bounds for a general class of probability flow ODEs under considerably weaker assumptions than previous work, extending convergence theory to more realistic data distributions and practical ODE solvers.

Conclusion: This work bridges a key theoretical challenge in diffusion-based generative modeling by extending convergence theory to practical scenarios, providing concrete guarantees for sampling algorithm efficiency and correctness, and offering practical guidance for hyperparameter selection.

Abstract: Score-based generative modeling, implemented through probability flow ODEs,
has shown impressive results in numerous practical settings. However, most
convergence guarantees rely on restrictive regularity assumptions on the target
distribution -- such as strong log-concavity or bounded support. This work
establishes non-asymptotic convergence bounds in the 2-Wasserstein distance for
a general class of probability flow ODEs under considerably weaker assumptions:
weak log-concavity and Lipschitz continuity of the score function. Our
framework accommodates non-log-concave distributions, such as Gaussian
mixtures, and explicitly accounts for initialization errors, score
approximation errors, and effects of discretization via an exponential
integrator scheme. Bridging a key theoretical challenge in diffusion-based
generative modeling, our results extend convergence theory to more realistic
data distributions and practical ODE solvers. We provide concrete guarantees
for the efficiency and correctness of the sampling algorithm, complementing the
empirical success of diffusion models with rigorous theory. Moreover, from a
practical perspective, our explicit rates might be helpful in choosing
hyperparameters, such as the step size in the discretization.

TL;DR: A robust evaluation framework for heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimators using relative error, with theoretical conditions, novel loss functions, neural network architecture, and a new HTE learning algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for heterogeneous treatment effect estimators are underdeveloped, creating a need for robust evaluation frameworks to reliably compare different HTE estimators.

Method: Proposed relative error-based evaluation framework with theoretical conditions on nuisance parameters, novel loss functions, neural network architecture for nuisance parameter estimation, and a new HTE learning algorithm that leverages existing estimators.

Result: The framework achieves robust estimation of relative error, supports reliable comparisons across HTE estimators, and the proposed learning algorithm demonstrates desirable performance in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation framework provides reliable assessment of HTE estimators, and the integrated learning algorithm enhances HTE estimation performance by leveraging both existing estimators and learned nuisance parameters.

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in heterogeneous treatment effect
(HTE) estimation, the evaluation of HTE estimators remains underdeveloped. In
this article, we propose a robust evaluation framework based on relative error,
which quantifies performance differences between two HTE estimators. We first
derive the key theoretical conditions on the nuisance parameters that are
necessary to achieve a robust estimator of relative error. Building on these
conditions, we introduce novel loss functions and design a neural network
architecture to estimate nuisance parameters and obtain robust estimation of
relative error, thereby achieving reliable evaluation of HTE estimators. We
provide the large sample properties of the proposed relative error estimator.
Furthermore, beyond evaluation, we propose a new learning algorithm for HTE
that leverages both the previously HTE estimators and the nuisance parameters
learned through our neural network architecture. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation framework supports reliable comparisons across
HTE estimators, and the proposed learning algorithm for HTE exhibits desirable
performance.

*Ziad Ghanem,Chang Hyunwoong,Preskella Mrad*

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework for symmetry detection in dynamical systems using Wasserstein distances and probabilistic model selection over candidate symmetry subgroups, with theoretical guarantees and applications to noisy data and biomechanical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symmetry detection methods rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures in dynamical systems.

Method: Bayesian framework formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over candidate subgroups using Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies, with Metropolis-Hastings sampling for posterior inference.

Result: The method demonstrates accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes in numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds, and reveals symmetry changes in human gait dynamics induced by mechanical constraints.

Conclusion: The Bayesian framework provides robust symmetry detection with uncertainty quantification, enabling statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems while establishing theoretical guarantees for minimal symmetry, frame-independence, and noise robustness.

Abstract: Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis,
providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge
as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties
of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across
conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport
methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this
setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty
quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve
hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that
formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice
of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein
distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish
three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal
symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring
frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for
robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings
sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and
synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise
and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry
changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's
utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.

TL;DR: This research proposes an LLM-based framework for extracting product/service attributes, features, and sentiments from customer reviews, demonstrating high accuracy and significant efficiency gains over manual coding while providing actionable business insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable, efficient method for analyzing customer reviews that provides interpretable and managerially actionable insights, overcoming the limitations of time-consuming manual coding processes.

Method: Systematic LLM approach grounded in marketing theory, distinguishing perceptual attributes from actionable features, applied to 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores with evaluation of eight prompt variants against human annotations.

Result: High consistency between LLMs and human coders (comparable insights), strong predictive validity for customer ratings, and massive efficiency improvement (2 seconds vs 6 minutes per review). Identified key attributes influencing satisfaction with potential for 1-2% revenue gains.

Conclusion: LLM-based review analysis provides reliable, scalable insights for businesses to identify joy/pain points, enabling targeted interventions and actionable marketing dashboards with significant efficiency advantages over manual methods.

Abstract: This research proposes a systematic, large language model (LLM) approach for
extracting product and service attributes, features, and associated sentiments
from customer reviews. Grounded in marketing theory, the framework
distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features, producing
interpretable and managerially actionable insights. We apply the methodology to
20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores and evaluate eight prompt variants on a
random subset of reviews. Model performance is assessed through agreement with
human annotations and predictive validity for customer ratings. Results show
high consistency between LLMs and human coders and strong predictive validity,
confirming the reliability of the approach. Human coders required a median of
six minutes per review, whereas the LLM processed each in two seconds,
delivering comparable insights at a scale unattainable through manual coding.
Managerially, the analysis identifies attributes and features that most
strongly influence customer satisfaction and their associated sentiments,
enabling firms to pinpoint "joy points," address "pain points," and design
targeted interventions. We demonstrate how structured review data can power an
actionable marketing dashboard that tracks sentiment over time and across
stores, benchmarks performance, and highlights high-leverage features for
improvement. Simulations indicate that enhancing sentiment for key service
features could yield 1-2% average revenue gains per store.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Schr√∂dinger Bridge methods are limited to pairwise time points, which is insufficient for systems with multiple intermediate snapshots where longitudinal tracking of individual entities is impossible, particularly in developmental biology and systems medicine.

Method: Multi-Marginal Schr√∂dinger Bridge Matching (MSBM) extends iterative Markovian fitting (IMF) to handle multiple marginal constraints, ensuring robust enforcement of all intermediate marginals while preserving continuity of learned global dynamics across the entire trajectory.

Result: Empirical validations on synthetic data and real-world single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate MSBM's competitive or superior performance in capturing complex trajectories and respecting intermediate distributions with notable computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MSBM provides an effective solution for trajectory inference from multiple temporal snapshots, addressing limitations of traditional pairwise SB methods and showing strong performance in biological applications.

Abstract: Understanding the continuous evolution of populations from discrete temporal
snapshots is a critical research challenge, particularly in fields like
developmental biology and systems medicine where longitudinal tracking of
individual entities is often impossible. Such trajectory inference is vital for
unraveling the mechanisms of dynamic processes. While Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB)
offer a potent framework, their traditional application to pairwise time points
can be insufficient for systems defined by multiple intermediate snapshots.
This paper introduces Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (MSBM), a
novel algorithm specifically designed for the multi-marginal SB problem. MSBM
extends iterative Markovian fitting (IMF) to effectively handle multiple
marginal constraints. This technique ensures robust enforcement of all
intermediate marginals while preserving the continuity of the learned global
dynamics across the entire trajectory. Empirical validations on synthetic data
and real-world single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate the competitive
or superior performance of MSBM in capturing complex trajectories and
respecting intermediate distributions, all with notable computational
efficiency.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces algorithms to optimize high-throughput screens for biological machine learning by focusing on collecting only positive examples when active sequences are rare, and using generative models to correct for missing negatives, achieving dramatic learning acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological machine learning faces data bottlenecks due to limited scaled data. High-throughput screens can test millions to trillions of protein sequences in parallel but are constrained by measurement and sequencing costs.

Method: The authors propose algorithms that collect only positive examples (active sequences) when active sequences are rare, then use generative models of the library to correct for missing negative examples, producing consistent estimates of p(y|x).

Result: The approach was demonstrated in simulation and on a large-scale antibody screen, showing that co-design of experiments and inference dramatically accelerates learning.

Conclusion: By co-designing experiments and inference, the researchers achieved significant learning acceleration in biological machine learning through optimized high-throughput screening strategies that maximize information gain while minimizing data collection costs.

Abstract: Biological machine learning is often bottlenecked by a lack of scaled data.
One promising route to relieving data bottlenecks is through high throughput
screens, which can experimentally test the activity of $10^6-10^{12}$ protein
sequences in parallel. In this article, we introduce algorithms to optimize
high throughput screens for data creation and model training. We focus on the
large scale regime, where dataset sizes are limited by the cost of measurement
and sequencing. We show that when active sequences are rare, we maximize
information gain if we only collect positive examples of active sequences, i.e.
$x$ with $y>0$. We can correct for the missing negative examples using a
generative model of the library, producing a consistent and efficient estimate
of the true $p(y | x)$. We demonstrate this approach in simulation and on a
large scale screen of antibodies. Overall, co-design of experiments and
inference lets us accelerate learning dramatically.

TL;DR: ARCO-BO is a collaborative Bayesian Optimization framework that addresses heterogeneity in multi-agent optimization through adaptive information sharing, resource coordination, and partial input space sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed optimization faces challenges with heterogeneous objectives, evaluation budgets, and accessible design variables across different agents, leading to poor coordination and resource utilization. Existing collaborative BO methods assume uniform resources and fully shared input spaces, which are rarely satisfied in practice.

Method: ARCO-BO combines three key components: similarity and optima-aware consensus mechanism for adaptive information sharing, budget-aware asynchronous sampling strategy for resource coordination, and partial input space sharing for heterogeneous design spaces.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and high-dimensional engineering problems show ARCO-BO consistently outperforms independent BO and existing collaborative BO via consensus approach, achieving robust and efficient performance in complex multi-agent settings.

Conclusion: ARCO-BO provides an effective framework for multi-agent optimization that explicitly handles heterogeneity, enabling better coordination and resource utilization in distributed optimization scenarios.

Abstract: Modern scientific and engineering design increasingly involves distributed
optimization, where agents such as laboratories, simulations, or industrial
partners pursue related goals under differing conditions. These agents often
face heterogeneities in objectives, evaluation budgets, and accessible design
variables, which complicates coordination and can lead to redundancy, poor
resource use, and ineffective information sharing. Bayesian Optimization (BO)
is a widely used decision-making framework for expensive black box functions,
but its single-agent formulation assumes centralized control and full data
sharing. Recent collaborative BO methods relax these assumptions, yet they
often require uniform resources, fully shared input spaces, and fixed task
alignment, conditions rarely satisfied in practice. To address these
challenges, we introduce Adaptive Resource Aware Collaborative Bayesian
Optimization (ARCO-BO), a framework that explicitly accounts for heterogeneity
in multi-agent optimization. ARCO-BO combines three components: a similarity
and optima-aware consensus mechanism for adaptive information sharing, a
budget-aware asynchronous sampling strategy for resource coordination, and a
partial input space sharing for heterogeneous design spaces. Experiments on
synthetic and high-dimensional engineering problems show that ARCO-BO
consistently outperforms independent BO and existing collaborative BO via
consensus approach, achieving robust and efficient performance in complex
multi-agent settings.

### [242] [Escaping Model Collapse via Synthetic Data Verification: Near-term Improvements and Long-term Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16657)
*Bingji Yi,Qiyuan Liu,Yuwei Cheng,Haifeng Xu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates how to prevent model collapse in synthetic data retraining by using external verifiers, showing that verified synthetic data can avoid collapse and even improve performance, though gains may plateau if verifiers are imperfect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about model collapse - the deterioration of model performance when iteratively retraining on self-generated synthetic data - and explore methods to prevent or reverse this trend.

Method: The study uses external synthetic data verifiers (human or better models) to inject information during synthetic retraining. Theoretical analysis is conducted in linear regression settings, with experimental validation on both linear regression and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) trained on MNIST data.

Result: Iterative retraining with verified synthetic data prevents model collapse and can yield near-term improvements. However, the parameter estimate ultimately converges to the verifier's "knowledge center," meaning gains plateau and may reverse if the verifier is imperfect.

Conclusion: External verification is crucial for preventing model collapse in synthetic data retraining, but the long-term performance depends on the reliability of the verifier, with imperfect verifiers leading to plateaued or reversed gains.

Abstract: Synthetic data has been increasingly used to train frontier generative
models. However, recent study raises key concerns that iteratively retraining a
generative model on its self-generated synthetic data may keep deteriorating
model performance, a phenomenon often coined model collapse. In this paper, we
investigate ways to modify this synthetic retraining process to avoid model
collapse, and even possibly help reverse the trend from collapse to
improvement. Our key finding is that by injecting information through an
external synthetic data verifier, whether a human or a better model, synthetic
retraining will not cause model collapse. To develop principled understandings
of the above insight, we situate our analysis in the foundational linear
regression setting, showing that iterative retraining with verified synthetic
data can yield near-term improvements but ultimately drives the parameter
estimate to the verifier's "knowledge center" in the long run. Our theory hence
predicts that, unless the verifier is perfectly reliable, the early gains will
plateau and may even reverse. Indeed, these theoretical insights are further
confirmed by our experiments on both linear regression as well as Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) trained on MNIST data.

*Daniel Augusto de Souza,Yuchen Zhu,Harry Jake Cunningham,Yuri Saporito,Diego Mesquita,Marc Peter Deisenroth*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper extends the neural network-Gaussian process connection to neural operators, showing conditions for convergence to function-valued GPs and computing covariance functions for practical applications like PDE solution operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve uncertainty quantification in neural operators by establishing their connection to Gaussian processes, similar to what exists for standard neural networks, and to uncover the inductive biases of current architectures.

Method: The authors derive conditions for when arbitrary-depth neural operators with Gaussian-distributed convolution kernels converge to function-valued Gaussian processes, and compute the covariance functions for different parametrizations including Fourier neural operators.

Result: The paper successfully establishes the neural operator-Gaussian process connection, provides computable covariance functions, and demonstrates how to compute GP posteriors in regression scenarios including PDE solution operators.

Conclusion: This work enables better uncertainty quantification for neural operators, reveals their inductive biases, and opens paths for incorporating novel inductive biases in kernel-based operator learning methods.

Abstract: A variety of infinitely wide neural architectures (e.g., dense NNs, CNNs, and
transformers) induce Gaussian process (GP) priors over their outputs. These
relationships provide both an accurate characterization of the prior predictive
distribution and enable the use of GP machinery to improve the uncertainty
quantification of deep neural networks. In this work, we extend this connection
to neural operators (NOs), a class of models designed to learn mappings between
function spaces. Specifically, we show conditions for when arbitrary-depth NOs
with Gaussian-distributed convolution kernels converge to function-valued GPs.
Based on this result, we show how to compute the covariance functions of these
NO-GPs for two NO parametrizations, including the popular Fourier neural
operator (FNO). With this, we compute the posteriors of these GPs in regression
scenarios, including PDE solution operators. This work is an important step
towards uncovering the inductive biases of current FNO architectures and opens
a path to incorporate novel inductive biases for use in kernel-based operator
learning methods.

TL;DR: A functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator combining signature transforms from rough path theory with kernel regression for path-valued data, achieving computational efficiency and competitive performance in regression and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient methods for nonparametric regression and classification of path-valued data by leveraging signature transforms to enable principled comparison of sequential data while avoiding computational bottlenecks of traditional kernel methods.

Method: Functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator that integrates signature transforms (providing iterated integral encodings of paths) with local kernel regression, using signature-induced distances within kernel framework and proposing robust variants for outlier stability.

Result: Established finite-sample convergence bounds showing favorable statistical properties, demonstrated competitive accuracy on synthetic and real-world data including SDE learning and time series classification, with significant computational advantages over existing methods.

Conclusion: Signature-based kernel regression provides an effective framework for path-valued data analysis, combining theoretical guarantees with practical computational efficiency and robustness, offering a scalable alternative to traditional functional data methods.

Abstract: We study nonparametric regression and classification for path-valued data. We
introduce a functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator that combines the signature
transform from rough path theory with local kernel regression. The signature
transform provides a principled way to encode sequential data through iterated
integrals, enabling direct comparison of paths in a natural metric space. Our
approach leverages signature-induced distances within the classical kernel
regression framework, achieving computational efficiency while avoiding the
scalability bottlenecks of large-scale kernel matrix operations. We establish
finite-sample convergence bounds demonstrating favorable statistical properties
of signature-based distances compared to traditional metrics in
infinite-dimensional settings. We propose robust signature variants that
provide stability against outliers, enhancing practical performance.
Applications to both synthetic and real-world data - including stochastic
differential equation learning and time series classification - demonstrate
competitive accuracy while offering significant computational advantages over
existing methods.

### [245] [Prediction-Augmented Trees for Reliable Statistical Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16937)
*Vikram Kher,Argyris Oikonomou,Manolis Zampetakis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new learning-augmented estimators (PART and PAQ) that safely incorporate ML predictions into statistical analysis for scientific discovery, improving upon existing methods like PPI and PPI++ with better confidence intervals and faster variance reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With ML's success in predictive tasks (like AlphaFold), scientists need safe ways to incorporate ML predictions into statistical analysis for scientific discovery, using limited gold-standard labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled data.

Method: Two new estimators: PART (Prediction-Augmented Residual Tree) - a decision-tree based estimator with greedy criterion, and PAQ (Prediction-Augmented Quadrature) - the theoretical limit of PART with infinite tree depth. Both combine gold-standard samples with ML predictions.

Result: PART outperforms existing methods in real-world datasets from ecology, astronomy, and census reports, providing higher confidence. PAQ achieves variance reduction at rate O(N^{-1} + n^{-4}), significantly improving on existing O(N^{-1} + n^{-1}) rates.

Conclusion: The proposed PART and PAQ estimators provide safer and more effective ways to incorporate ML predictions into scientific statistical analysis, with proven theoretical advantages and superior empirical performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: The remarkable success of machine learning (ML) in predictive tasks has led
scientists to incorporate ML predictions as a core component of the scientific
discovery pipeline. This was exemplified by the landmark achievement of
AlphaFold (Jumper et al. (2021)). In this paper, we study how ML predictions
can be safely used in statistical analysis of data towards scientific
discovery. In particular, we follow the framework introduced by Angelopoulos et
al. (2023). In this framework, we assume access to a small set of $n$
gold-standard labeled samples, a much larger set of $N$ unlabeled samples, and
a ML model that can be used to impute the labels of the unlabeled data points.
We introduce two new learning-augmented estimators: (1) Prediction-Augmented
Residual Tree (PART), and (2) Prediction-Augmented Quadrature (PAQ). Both
estimators have significant advantages over existing estimators like PPI and
PPI++ introduced by Angelopoulos et al. (2023) and Angelopoulos et al. (2024),
respectively. PART is a decision-tree based estimator built using a greedy
criterion. We first characterize PART's asymptotic distribution and demonstrate
how to construct valid confidence intervals. Then we show that PART outperforms
existing methods in real-world datasets from ecology, astronomy, and census
reports, among other domains. This leads to estimators with higher confidence,
which is the result of using both the gold-standard samples and the machine
learning predictions. Finally, we provide a formal proof of the advantage of
PART by exploring PAQ, an estimation that arises when considering the limit of
PART when the depth its tree grows to infinity. Under appropriate assumptions
in the input data we show that the variance of PAQ shrinks at rate of $O(N^{-1}
+ n^{-4})$, improving significantly on the $O(N^{-1}+n^{-1})$ rate of existing
methods.

*Hamza Cherkaoui,H√©l√®ne Halconruy,Yohan Petetin*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A data-driven method for sample sharing in ridge regression that leverages auxiliary datasets while preventing negative transfer, using transfer gain estimation to determine optimal sample borrowing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of scarce labeled data in business settings by enabling safe transfer learning from auxiliary datasets without negative transfer effects.

Method: Develop a principled rule based on transfer gain estimation to determine how many samples to borrow from auxiliary datasets, with finite-sample guarantees and analysis of Gaussian feature settings.

Result: The method consistently outperforms strong baselines and single-task training in synthetic and real datasets, achieving predictive gains while avoiding negative transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed sample sharing approach provides a safe and effective way to leverage auxiliary data for ridge regression tasks, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: In many business settings, task-specific labeled data are scarce or costly to
obtain, which limits supervised learning on a specific task. To address this
challenge, we study sample sharing in the case of ridge regression: leveraging
an auxiliary data set while explicitly protecting against negative transfer. We
introduce a principled, data-driven rule that decides how many samples from an
auxiliary dataset to add to the target training set. The rule is based on an
estimate of the transfer gain i.e. the marginal reduction in the predictive
error. Building on this estimator, we derive finite-sample guaranties: under
standard conditions, the procedure borrows when it improves parameter
estimation and abstains otherwise. In the Gaussian feature setting, we analyze
which data set properties ensure that borrowing samples reduces the predictive
error. We validate the approach in synthetic and real datasets, observing
consistent gains over strong baselines and single-task training while avoiding
negative transfer.

### [247] [Mode Collapse of Mean-Field Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17063)
*Shunan Sheng,Bohan Wu,Alberto Gonz√°lez-Sanz*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper provides the first theoretical explanation of mode collapse in mean-field variational inference (MFVI) when approximating mixture distributions, and proposes a new method called rotational variational inference (RoVI) to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MFVI is widely used but empirically observed to suffer from mode collapse when approximating mixture distributions, where it tends to place most mass near a single component rather than capturing the full mixture structure. The authors aim to provide the first theoretical understanding of this phenomenon.

Method: The authors introduce the concept of Œµ-separateness to quantify how separated mixture components are, and derive theoretical bounds on mass assignment in MFVI optimizers. They then propose RoVI, which augments MFVI with a rotation matrix to better capture mixture structure.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that mode collapse in MFVI crucially depends on the relative position of mixture components. Numerical studies demonstrate that RoVI successfully addresses mode collapse and provides better approximation of mixture distributions compared to standard MFVI.

Conclusion: This work provides the first theoretical framework explaining mode collapse in MFVI and introduces RoVI as an effective solution that maintains the computational efficiency of MFVI while better capturing mixture structures through rotational augmentation.

Abstract: Mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is a widely used method for
approximating high-dimensional probability distributions by product measures.
It has been empirically observed that MFVI optimizers often suffer from mode
collapse. Specifically, when the target measure $\pi$ is a mixture $\pi = w P_0
+ (1 - w) P_1$, the MFVI optimizer tends to place most of its mass near a
single component of the mixture. This work provides the first theoretical
explanation of mode collapse in MFVI. We introduce the notion to capture the
separatedness of the two mixture components -- called
$\varepsilon$-separateness -- and derive explicit bounds on the fraction of
mass that any MFVI optimizer assigns to each component when $P_0$ and $P_1$ are
$\varepsilon$-separated for sufficiently small $\varepsilon$. Our results
suggest that the occurrence of mode collapse crucially depends on the relative
position of the components. To address this issue, we propose the rotational
variational inference (RoVI), which augments MFVI with a rotation matrix. The
numerical studies support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the benefits
of RoVI.

*Kyum Kim,Yaqing Chen,Paromita Dubey*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Deep Fr√©chet neural networks (DFNNs) are proposed as an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting non-Euclidean responses (like distributions, networks, matrices) from Euclidean predictors by approximating conditional Fr√©chet means.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression with non-Euclidean responses has become increasingly important in modern applications, but existing methods have limitations in handling diverse metric spaces and high-dimensional predictors.

Method: DFNNs leverage deep neural networks to approximate conditional Fr√©chet means by minimizing Fr√©chet risk, accommodating diverse metrics and high-dimensional predictors without model assumptions or local smoothing.

Result: A universal approximation theorem is established for DFNNs, and empirical studies on synthetic distributional/network-valued responses and real-world occupational composition prediction show DFNNs consistently outperform existing methods.

Conclusion: DFNNs provide a flexible and powerful framework for regression with non-Euclidean responses, advancing neural network approximation theory for general metric-space-valued responses.

Abstract: Regression with non-Euclidean responses -- e.g., probability distributions,
networks, symmetric positive-definite matrices, and compositions -- has become
increasingly important in modern applications. In this paper, we propose deep
Fr\'echet neural networks (DFNNs), an end-to-end deep learning framework for
predicting non-Euclidean responses -- which are considered as random objects in
a metric space -- from Euclidean predictors. Our method leverages the
representation-learning power of deep neural networks (DNNs) to the task of
approximating conditional Fr\'echet means of the response given the predictors,
the metric-space analogue of conditional expectations, by minimizing a
Fr\'echet risk. The framework is highly flexible, accommodating diverse metrics
and high-dimensional predictors. We establish a universal approximation theorem
for DFNNs, advancing the state-of-the-art of neural network approximation
theory to general metric-space-valued responses without making model
assumptions or relying on local smoothing. Empirical studies on synthetic
distributional and network-valued responses, as well as a real-world
application to predicting employment occupational compositions, demonstrate
that DFNNs consistently outperform existing methods.

### [249] [Optimal Best Arm Identification under Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17348)
*Marc Jourdan,Achraf Azize*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap between lower and upper bounds for Best Arm Identification (BAI) under global Differential Privacy (DP) for Bernoulli distributions, achieving near-optimal performance with a small multiplicative constant gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BAI algorithms are used in privacy-sensitive applications like clinical trials and user studies, creating a need for differentially private BAI algorithms. However, there exists a significant performance gap between lower and upper bounds in the global DP setting that needs to be addressed.

Method: The authors develop a three-part approach: (1) a tighter lower bound using a new information-theoretic quantity that optimally trades off KL divergence and Total Variation distance scaled by epsilon, (2) a stopping rule based on transportation costs with private estimators using arm-dependent geometric batching, and (3) a Top Two sampling rule based on the same transportation costs.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves an asymptotic upper bound on expected sample complexity that matches the lower bound to a multiplicative constant smaller than 8, outperforming existing differentially private BAI algorithms for various epsilon values.

Conclusion: This work significantly reduces the performance gap in differentially private BAI, providing near-optimal algorithms with strong privacy guarantees while maintaining competitive sample complexity.

Abstract: Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithms are deployed in data-sensitive
applications, such as adaptive clinical trials or user studies. Driven by the
privacy concerns of these applications, we study the problem of
fixed-confidence BAI under global Differential Privacy (DP) for Bernoulli
distributions. While numerous asymptotically optimal BAI algorithms exist in
the non-private setting, a significant gap remains between the best lower and
upper bounds in the global DP setting. This work reduces this gap to a small
multiplicative constant, for any privacy budget $\epsilon$. First, we provide a
tighter lower bound on the expected sample complexity of any $\delta$-correct
and $\epsilon$-global DP strategy. Our lower bound replaces the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in the transportation cost used by the
non-private characteristic time with a new information-theoretic quantity that
optimally trades off between the KL divergence and the Total Variation distance
scaled by $\epsilon$. Second, we introduce a stopping rule based on these
transportation costs and a private estimator of the means computed using an
arm-dependent geometric batching. En route to proving the correctness of our
stopping rule, we derive concentration results of independent interest for the
Laplace distribution and for the sum of Bernoulli and Laplace distributions.
Third, we propose a Top Two sampling rule based on these transportation costs.
For any budget $\epsilon$, we show an asymptotic upper bound on its expected
sample complexity that matches our lower bound to a multiplicative constant
smaller than $8$. Our algorithm outperforms existing $\delta$-correct and
$\epsilon$-global DP BAI algorithms for different values of $\epsilon$.

### [250] [Certified Self-Consistency: Statistical Guarantees and Test-Time Training for Reliable Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17472)
*Paula Cordero-Encinar,Andrew B. Duncan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A unified statistical framework for certifiable inference in LLMs that explains self-consistency and test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL), providing finite-sample guarantees and adaptive stopping rules for reliable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods like self-consistency and TTRL improve LLM reliability without supervision, but their underlying mechanisms and statistical guarantees remain poorly understood.

Method: Developed majority voting certificates with finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration bounds, introduced Martingale Majority Certificate (MMC) for adaptive stopping, and showed TTRL sharpens distributions via exponential tilting.

Result: Majority voting provides statistical certificates for self-consistency, MMC adaptively determines sufficient samples, and TTRL reduces certification samples by distribution sharpening.

Conclusion: The framework unifies self-consistency and TTRL within a single statistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances such as self-consistency and test-time reinforcement learning
(TTRL) improve the reliability of large language models (LLMs) without
additional supervision, yet their underlying mechanisms and statistical
guarantees remain poorly understood. We present a unified framework for
certifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a
statistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the
aggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution
with high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration
bounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority
Certificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when
sufficient samples have been drawn. We further prove that label-free
post-training methods such as TTRL implicitly sharpen the answer distribution
by exponentially tilting it toward its mode, thereby reducing the number of
samples required for certification. Building on this insight, we propose new
post-training objectives that explicitly optimise this trade-off between
sharpness and bias. Together, these results explain and connect two central
test-time scaling strategies, self-consistency and TTRL, within a single
statistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning
LLMs.
