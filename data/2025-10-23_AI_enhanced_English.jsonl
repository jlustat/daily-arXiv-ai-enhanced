Numerous data-driven\nmethods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a\ntypical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of\nmultiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the\nsampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events\nbut with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To\novercome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or\n$\\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the\navailable data. $\\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'\nextreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an\nobservable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available\nthrough qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of\nstatistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while\nenforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the\ngeneration of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack\nextremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a\nrigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method.\nAdditionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable\nproperties of the $\\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and\nreal-world precipitation downscaling problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduces \u03b7-learning, a method that enables accurate prediction of extreme events even when training data lacks such events, using statistical regularization to enforce extreme event statistics during training.", "motivation": "Current data-driven methods for predicting rare/extreme events require multiple extreme events in training data, leading to high uncertainty in extreme regions when such data is unavailable.", "method": "\u03b7-learning uses statistical regularization to enforce extreme event statistics of an observable during training, without requiring actual extreme events in the data.

Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity.
