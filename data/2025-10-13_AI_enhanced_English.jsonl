Under Review", "summary": "Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between\nlocally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that\nare rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing\nmodels typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time\nsteps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,\nand limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a\nlightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization\nthat adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into\ncompact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points\nacross multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence\ncriterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or\ngenerative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence\ncompression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a\nmodel-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised\ntime series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+\ndatasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30\narchives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,\ndemonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\\% of the full-model performance while\noffering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves\nrobustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming\nuniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position\nSTaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware\ntime series modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "STaTS is an unsupervised framework that compresses time series into compact token sequences by detecting change points across multiple resolutions and summarizing segments, achieving up to 30x compression while preserving temporal dynamics.", "motivation": "Standard time series models treat all time steps equally, leading to inefficiencies and poor robustness.

We evaluate our\nmethod on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.\nFirst, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task\nusing synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample\nsettings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks\nwhich simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology.
