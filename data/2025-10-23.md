### [1] [3D Optimization for AI Inference Scaling: Balancing Accuracy, Cost, and Latency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18905)
*Minseok Jung,Abhas Ricky,Muhammad Rameez Chatni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 3D optimization framework for AI inference scaling that jointly optimizes accuracy, cost, and latency, overcoming limitations of traditional 1D and 2D approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI inference scaling uses 1D heuristics or 2D trade-offs that fail to consider cost and latency constraints, leading to suboptimal deployment decisions.

Method: Monte Carlo simulations across three scenarios and nine simulated LLMs, evaluating four optimization methods for 3D multi-objective optimization to enable constraints-aware inference scaling.

Result: Knee-point optimization achieves the best balance across objectives, while accuracy-maximization remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The 3D framework reveals a feasible space that 1D/2D approaches miss.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse operational contexts, enabling environment-adaptive selection of inference scaling parameters.

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

### [2] [Large Connectome Model: An fMRI Foundation Model of Brain Connectomes Empowered by Brain-Environment Interaction in Multitask Learning Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18910)
*Ziquan Wei,Tingting Dan,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A foundation model for functional neuroimages using multitask learning with brain-environment interactions and semi-supervised fine-tuning, showing strong performance on various clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for neuroimaging are limited by small sample sizes, and existing foundation models using self-supervised learning are suboptimal for downstream tasks like disease prediction.

Method: Multitask pretraining by tokenizing brain-environment interactions (BEI) and semi-supervised fine-tuning using pseudo-labels from pretrained BEI, leveraging rich environmental variables and demographic data.

Result: Promising results on sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Schizophrenia.

Conclusion: The foundation model has great potential to facilitate neuroimaging applications in clinical routines by addressing sample size limitations and improving task alignment.

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

### [3] [ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913)
*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADPO is a unified framework that extends DPO with soft preferences, reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions, offering improved performance in noisy preference scenarios across contextual bandits and sequential RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, which can be limiting in real-world scenarios with uncertainty and noise. ADPO aims to address these limitations by introducing more flexible preference modeling.

Method: ADPO introduces three key components: (1) soft preference probabilities to encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift, (2) arbitrary reference-policy anchors for training stability via groupwise shift invariance and implicit KL regularization, and (3) listwise preference modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions.

Result: ADPO significantly outperforms standard DPO: anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% in contextual bandits, KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed contamination (112% relative gain), and anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by 15-29% in sequential RL tasks.

Conclusion: ADPO provides clear practical guidance: use pairwise anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise scenarios, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for extreme contamination cases, with proven transferability from single-step to multi-step settings.

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

*Oluwaseun A. Ajayi,Ogundepo Odunayo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a performance evaluation of Apple's MLX framework for transformer model inference on Apple silicon devices, comparing it with PyTorch implementations and benchmarking against NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of LLMs and machine learning has created a need for frameworks that can efficiently deploy models on smaller devices like laptops and mobile phones, particularly leveraging Apple silicon hardware.

Method: The researchers created MLX-transformers framework with different transformer implementations in MLX, converted PyTorch checkpoints to MLX format, and benchmarked inference latency of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa models on Apple Silicon MacBooks against NVIDIA CUDA GPU.

Result: The study demonstrates MLX's potential for efficient on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem, showing competitive performance compared to traditional GPU implementations.

Conclusion: MLX shows promise in enabling efficient and accessible on-device machine learning applications by leveraging Apple Silicon's advanced architecture, eliminating the need for complex checkpoint conversions between frameworks.

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

### [5] [Noise-corrected GRPO: From Noisy Rewards to Unbiased Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18924)
*Omar El mansouri,Mohamed El Amine Seddik,Salem Lahlou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRPO and Dr.GRPO, noise-robust policy optimization methods that model reward corruption as Bernoulli noise and apply noise correction to debias learning signals, achieving significant improvements in math and code tasks under noisy reward conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLHF/RLVR methods are highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous rewards, and the interaction between such noise and group-based policy optimization methods remains underexplored.

Method: Introduces Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO) framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise, applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.

Result: Consistent improvements across math and code tasks, with gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code tasks under realistic reward model conditions.

Conclusion: This work bridges label-noise correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment, showing that group-based methods inherently mitigate individual-level noise and the correction strategy amplifies this robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

### [6] [Application of Reduced-Order Models for Temporal Multiscale Representations in the Prediction of Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18925)
*Elias Al Ghazal,Jad Mounayer,Beatriz Moya,Sebastian Rodriguez,Chady Ghnatios,Francisco Chinesta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Three multiscale learning approaches using Partition of Unity with neural networks, Singular Value Decomposition, and Sparse High-Order SVD to capture both macro- and micro-scale dynamics in complex systems from limited measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning methods fail to capture high-frequency behaviors in complex multiscale systems due to inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to initial conditions.

Method: 1) Partition of Unity method with neural networks to decompose dynamics into local components; 2) Singular Value Decomposition to extract dominant modes separating macro- and micro-scale dynamics; 3) Sparse High-Order SVD for reconstruction from limited measurements.

Result: The framework accurately captures both coarse and fine dynamics, making it effective for real-world applications with complex multi-scale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches provide effective multiscale learning that can handle complex systems with incomplete data while capturing dynamics across all time scales present in the phenomena.

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

### [7] [BAPO: Stabilizing Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for LLMs via Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18927)
*Zhiheng Xi,Xin Guo,Yang Nan,Enyu Zhou,Junrui Shen,Wenxiang Chen,Jiaqi Liu,Jixuan Huang,Zhihao Zhang,Honglin Guo,Xun Deng,Zhikai Lei,Miao Zheng,Guoteng Wang,Shuo Zhang,Peng Sun,Rui Zheng,Hang Yan,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAPO addresses RL instability in off-policy LLM training by dynamically adjusting clipping bounds to balance positive/negative gradients and preserve entropy, achieving SOTA results on AIME benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL in off-policy settings for LLMs faces challenges: sharp entropy decline, unstable optimization, and potential collapse due to negative-advantage sample dominance and fixed clipping mechanisms that block entropy-increasing updates.

Method: Proposes BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO) - dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to re-balance positive/negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization in off-policy scenarios including sample replay and partial rollout.

Result: Achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. 7B BAPO model surpasses SkyWork-OR1-7B; 32B BAPO achieves SOTA among same-scale models and outperforms proprietary systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking on AIME 2024/2025 benchmarks.

Conclusion: BAPO effectively addresses RL optimization challenges in off-policy LLM training through adaptive clipping, enabling stable and efficient learning while achieving superior performance compared to both open-source and proprietary alternatives.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

### [8] [Statistical Inference for Linear Functionals of Online Least-squares SGD when $t \gtrsim d^{1+δ}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19734)
*Bhavya Agrawalla,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Promit Ghosal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes non-asymptotic Berry-Esseen bounds for linear functionals of online least-squares SGD, providing Gaussian CLT guarantees in growing-dimensional regimes with improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying SGD in high-stakes applications requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. Existing high-dimensional inference methods for projection parameters are computationally expensive and restrictive in dimensional scaling, requiring t ≳ d³/² iterations for finite-sample guarantees.

Method: The authors develop an online SGD-based procedure that operates in O(td) time with O(d) memory, significantly more efficient than covariance-inversion methods that require O(td² + d³) runtime. They also develop an online variance estimator for the asymptotic variance in the CLT.

Result: The method achieves a CLT for SGD iterates when t ≳ d¹⁺δ for any δ > 0, extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works. The approach provides the first fully online and data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in the near-optimal scaling regime.

Conclusion: This work provides a computationally efficient and theoretically sound framework for uncertainty quantification in SGD, enabling practical deployment in high-stakes applications with improved dimensional scaling and reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

### [9] [Position: Many generalization measures for deep learning are fragile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18934)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Many post-mortem generalization measures for deep neural networks are fragile - small training modifications that barely affect the DNN can substantially change measure values, trends, or scaling behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that many widely used generalization measures are fragile and unreliable for reproducing qualitative generalization trends, and to advocate for fragility audits in new measure development.

Method: Analyzing various post-mortem generalization measures (path norm, spectral norm, Frobenius norm, flatness proxies, deterministic PAC-Bayes surrogates) by observing how minor hyperparameter changes affect their behavior, and comparing with function-based marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound.

Result: Found that small training modifications like learning rate adjustments or switching SGD variants can reverse learning curve slopes in measures like path norm. PAC-Bayes origin measure is less sensitive to hyperparameters but fails to capture data complexity differences, while function-based PAC-Bayes captures data complexity but isn't post-mortem.

Conclusion: Many generalization bounds are fragile and unreliable for trend analysis. Developers should explicitly audit new measures for fragility to ensure they provide meaningful insights about generalization behavior.

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

### [10] [NeuroAda: Activating Each Neuron's Potential for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18940)
*Zhi Zhang,Yixian Shen,Congfeng Cao,Ekaterina Shutova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAda is a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that combines selective parameter identification with bypass connections to achieve fine-grained adaptation while maintaining high memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile the trade-off between addition-based PEFT methods (memory efficient but limited representational capacity) and selective in-situ adaptation (precise adaptation but high memory consumption).

Method: First identifies important parameters through selective adaptation, then introduces bypass connections for these selected parameters. During fine-tuning, only the bypass connections are updated while original model parameters remain frozen.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 23+ tasks spanning natural language generation and understanding with ≤0.02% trainable parameters, while reducing CUDA memory usage by up to 60%.

Conclusion: NeuroAda successfully enables fine-grained model fine-tuning while maintaining high memory efficiency, offering a practical solution to the PEFT trade-off problem.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

### [11] [Towards Universal Solvers: Using PGD Attack in Active Learning to Increase Generalizability of Neural Operators as Knowledge Distillation from Numerical PDE Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18989)
*Yifei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial teacher-student distillation framework improves neural operators' out-of-distribution generalization while maintaining fast inference and low parameter cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators offer fast inference but suffer from poor OOD generalization, while traditional PDE solvers are computationally expensive.

Method: Uses differentiable numerical solver as teacher, compact neural operator as student, with PGD-style adversarial sampling to find worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints.

Result: Experiments on Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems show substantial improvement in OOD robustness while preserving fast inference.

Conclusion: Adversarial distillation effectively enhances neural operators' generalization capabilities without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

### [12] [An Encode-then-Decompose Approach to Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection on Contaminated Training Data--Extended Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18998)
*Buang Zhang,Tung Kieu,Xiangfei Qiu,Chenjuan Guo,Jilin Hu,Aoying Zhou,Christian S. Jensen,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm for unsupervised time series anomaly detection that decomposes encoded representations into stable and auxiliary components to improve robustness against contaminated training data, along with a mutual information-based metric to replace reconstruction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoencoder-based unsupervised anomaly detection methods are sensitive to anomalies in training data, which reduces their accuracy. There's a need for more robust approaches that can handle contaminated time series during training without requiring labeled anomaly data.

Method: The authors introduce an encode-then-decompose paradigm that decomposes encoded representations into stable and auxiliary representations. They also propose using mutual information as a metric instead of traditional reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies.

Result: The proposed method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multivariate and univariate time series benchmarks and demonstrates robustness across different contamination ratios in training data.

Conclusion: The encode-then-decompose paradigm with mutual information-based anomaly scoring provides an effective and robust approach for unsupervised time series anomaly detection, particularly when dealing with contaminated training datasets.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to

patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000

cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine

TL;DR: The paper extends a theoretical framework to artificial neural networks, showing that categorical perception (enhanced discrimination near category boundaries) emerges from minimizing Bayes cost and maximizing mutual information, leading to neural space expansion near decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how categorical perception phenomena observed in animals and artificial neural networks emerge from efficient learning principles, and to extend previous neuroscience-based modeling to artificial networks.

Method: Theoretical framework based on minimizing Bayes cost (cross-entropy loss) and maximizing mutual information between categories and neural activities. Analysis of Fisher information matrices for neural representation and category sensitivity, with numerical validation on toy models and MNIST dataset.

Result: Optimal learning makes neural Fisher information follow category-specific Fisher information, expanding neural space near decision boundaries. The maxima of categorical Fisher information are found near (not exactly at) class boundaries. Numerical experiments confirm alignment between the two Fisher information matrices with category boundaries.

Conclusion: Category learning induces neural space expansion near decision boundaries as a consequence of efficient learning. The approach relates to Information Bottleneck theory and provides a bias-variance decomposition of Bayes cost, with categorical Fisher information eigenvectors revealing most discriminant directions.

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

### [15] [Knowledge Distillation of Uncertainty using Deep Latent Factor Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19290)
*Sehyun Park,Jongjin Lee,Yunseop Shin,Ilsang Ohn,Yongdai Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gaussian distillation compresses deep ensembles into a single student distribution using a deep latent factor model, outperforming existing methods while maintaining uncertainty quantification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep ensembles provide excellent uncertainty quantification but are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, making them impractical for real-world applications like on-device AI. Knowledge distillation methods struggle to preserve uncertainty when compressing ensembles.

Method: Proposes Gaussian distillation using a deep latent factor model (DLF) that treats ensemble members as realizations of a stochastic process. Uses expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to stably estimate mean and covariance functions, compressing teacher ensembles into student distributions rather than student ensembles.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on multiple benchmark datasets. Works well for language model fine-tuning and distribution shift problems while maintaining uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: Gaussian distillation effectively compresses deep ensembles into compact student distributions while preserving uncertainty quantification, offering practical deployment advantages over traditional ensemble methods.

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

### [16] [Empowering Decision Trees via Shape Function Branching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19040)
*Nakul Upadhya,Eldan Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Shape Generalized Trees (SGTs) as an interpretable alternative to traditional decision trees, using learnable shape functions instead of linear splits to capture non-linear patterns while maintaining visual interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision trees rely on simple axis-aligned linear splits, which often require deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects, undermining human comprehension and interpretability.

Method: Proposes Shape Generalized Trees (SGTs) where each internal node applies a learnable axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich non-linear partitioning. Introduces ShapeCART algorithm for learning SGTs, and extends to bivariate shape functions (S²GT) and multi-way trees (SGTₖ) with corresponding learning algorithms.

Result: Experiments show SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees across various datasets.

Conclusion: SGTs provide an interpretable and efficient alternative to traditional decision trees by using learnable shape functions that capture non-linear patterns while maintaining visual explainability and reducing model complexity.

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

### [17] [POLAR: Policy-based Layerwise Reinforcement Learning Method for Stealthy Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19056)
*Kuai Yu,Xiaoyu Wu,Peishen Yan,Qingqian Yang,Linshan Jiang,Hao Wang,Yang Hua,Tao Song,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POLAR is a novel RL-based approach for selecting backdoor-critical layers in federated learning attacks, achieving up to 40% higher success rates against state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining stealthiness through regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor-critical layer selection methods in federated learning are rule-based and don't consider layer interrelations, making them ineffective and detectable by advanced defenses.

Method: POLAR uses policy-based reinforcement learning with Bernoulli sampling to dynamically learn attack strategies, optimizing layer selection through policy gradient updates based on backdoor success rate improvements, with regularization to limit modified layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40% against six state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: POLAR demonstrates that RL-based layer selection is highly effective for backdoor attacks in federated learning, significantly improving attack success while maintaining stealthiness.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

### [18] [Scalable LinUCB: Low-Rank Design Matrix Updates for Recommenders with Large Action Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19349)
*Evgenia Shustova,Marina Sheshukova,Sergey Samsonov,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scalable LinUCB algorithm that reduces computational and memory costs in linear contextual bandits through dynamical low-rank parametrization of inverse Cholesky factors, achieving O(dr) complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LinUCB becomes computationally expensive with high-dimensional features and large action spaces due to the need to update, invert and store large design matrices.

Method: Uses dynamical low-rank parametrization of inverse Cholesky-style factors with numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates, combined with projector-splitting integrator for memory control.

Result: Achieves average per-step update cost O(dr) and memory O(dr) for approximation rank r, with inference complexity O(dr) per action evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed Scalable LinUCB algorithm effectively reduces computational and memory requirements while maintaining performance in recommender system applications.

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

### [19] [Weight Decay may matter more than muP for Learning Rate Transfer in Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19093)
*Atli Kosson,Jeremy Welborn,Yang Liu,Martin Jaggi,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) assumptions, showing weight decay rather than muP stabilizes update dynamics across neural network widths, enabling learning rate transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why muP works for learning rate transfer across neural network scales and identify the actual mechanisms behind successful transfer.

Method: Large-scale empirical investigation of muP assumptions and update dynamics across different model widths, particularly in LLM training scenarios.

Result: muP assumptions hold only briefly at training start; weight decay stabilizes update dynamics for most of training; muP primarily acts as implicit learning rate warmup.

Conclusion: Weight decay, not muP, enables learning rate transfer; muP can be largely replaced with modified warmup schedules, challenging prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer mechanisms.

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

### [20] [Policy Learning with Abstention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19672)
*Ayush Sawarni,Jikai Jin,Justin Whitehouse,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies policy learning with abstention, where policies can defer to safe defaults when uncertain. The authors propose a two-stage learner that identifies near-optimal policies and constructs abstention rules from their disagreements, achieving fast O(1/n) regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most policy learning methods force decisions even when predictions are uncertain, which is risky in high-stakes applications like personalized medicine and advertising. The authors aim to address this by allowing policies to abstain when uncertain.

Method: A two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. The approach uses doubly robust objectives for unknown propensities and establishes formal regret guarantees.

Result: The method achieves fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and extends these to unknown-propensity cases via doubly robust objectives. Abstention also enables improved guarantees under margin conditions and connects to distributionally robust policy learning.

Conclusion: Abstention is a versatile tool that enables safe policy learning in high-stakes settings, provides improved theoretical guarantees without realizability assumptions, connects to distributional robustness, and supports safe policy improvement over baselines with high probability.

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

### [21] [What Makes a Good Curriculum? Disentangling the Effects of Data Ordering on LLM Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19099)
*Yaning Jia,Chunhui Zhang,Xingjian Diao,Xiangchi Yuan,Zhongyu Ouyang,soroush vosoughi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Curriculum learning's effectiveness depends on model capability and task complexity, with no universal strategy. Different difficulty metrics produce distinct gains, and task-aligned vs inner-state curricula affect different aspects of learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fundamental questions about curriculum learning in LLMs: when it helps, which direction (forward/reverse) is better, and whether effectiveness depends on what is measured, given disparate prior approaches.

Method: Developed unified offline evaluation framework with five difficulty dimensions, conducted controlled post-training experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma3-4B.

Result: No curriculum strategy dominates universally; effectiveness depends on model capability and task complexity. Different difficulty levels produce distinct gains, and task-aligned vs inner-state curricula affect different learning aspects (representations vs internal states).

Conclusion: Challenges the notion of universal curriculum strategy, provides actionable guidance across models and tasks, and suggests prioritizing decision-uncertain samples may enhance learning outcomes.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

### [22] [MetaCluster: Enabling Deep Compression of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19105)
*Matthew Raffel,Adwaith Renjith,Lizhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaCluster is a framework that compresses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) by using a meta-learner to map embeddings to coefficient vectors, clustering them via K-means, and replacing per-edge vectors with shared centroids, achieving up to 80× parameter reduction without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs replace scalar weights with per-edge vectors of basis coefficients, increasing expressivity but also multiplying parameters and memory usage, creating a need for compression without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: A lightweight meta-learner is trained jointly with the KAN to map low-dimensional embeddings to coefficient vectors, shaping them onto a low-dimensional manifold. K-means clustering is applied in coefficient space, replacing per-edge vectors with shared centroids. The meta-learner is then discarded, and the centroid codebook is fine-tuned to recover any accuracy loss.

Result: On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, across standard KANs and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves up to 80× reduction in parameter storage with no loss in accuracy.

Conclusion: MetaCluster effectively compresses KANs by exploiting the vector nature of their parameters, enabling significant storage reduction while maintaining model performance through clustering and fine-tuning techniques.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [23] [Learning Peer Influence Probabilities with Linear Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19119)
*Ahmed Sayeed Faruk,Mohammad Shahverdikondori,Elena Zheleva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies learning peer influence probabilities in networked environments using contextual linear bandits, addressing the trade-off between regret minimization and estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peer influence probabilities are highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, making accurate estimation crucial for understanding information diffusion and improving viral marketing. However, existing methods either fail to reveal true influence relationships from static data or waste resources through random exploration in online learning.

Method: The authors propose a contextual linear bandit framework and develop an uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that can tune a parameter to achieve any desired trade-off between regret minimization and estimation error.

Result: Experiments on semi-synthetic network datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms static methods and contextual bandits that ignore the trade-off between regret and estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The work successfully characterizes the fundamental trade-off between regret minimization and estimation error in learning peer influence probabilities, and provides a tunable algorithm that can achieve any desired balance within this trade-off.

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MusicRFM adapts Recursive Feature Machines to enable fine-grained control over frozen music models by steering internal activations, achieving high note accuracy (0.23 to 0.82) with minimal impact on text prompt fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing controllable music generation methods often require model retraining or introduce audible artifacts, creating a need for methods that can control pre-trained models without compromising quality.

Method: Train lightweight RFM probes to discover interpretable concept directions in MusicGen's hidden states, then inject these directions during inference to guide generation in real-time without per-step optimization, using dynamic schedules and multi-property enforcement.

Result: Increased target note generation accuracy from 0.23 to 0.82 while maintaining text prompt adherence within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity.

Conclusion: MusicRFM successfully navigates the trade-off between control and generation quality, providing interpretable control over frozen music models without retraining or significant artifacts.

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

*Ziyi Zhang,Shaogang Ren,Xiaoning Qian,Nick Duffield*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC) to address limitations of traditional Granger causality by handling latent confounders and unknown interventions using cross-environment heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Granger causality fails with non-linear relationships and relies on unrealistic assumptions of causal sufficiency and known interventions. Real-world time series often have latent confounders and unknown intervention targets.

Method: Leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate latent confounding effects and distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with edge-level granularity, recovering invariant causal relations.

Result: Establishes identifiability under challenging conditions and demonstrates competitive performance on synthetic and real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: InvarGC effectively addresses key limitations of existing Granger causality methods by handling latent confounders and unknown interventions through cross-environment analysis, showing strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies subliminal corruption in AI systems - the transmission of undesirable traits through semantically neutral synthetic data that bypasses safety checks. Using GPT-2 in teacher-student experiments, they find corruption causes behavioral crossover, occurs via sharp phase transitions at critical data thresholds, and mimics natural fine-tuning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data, there's a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through interconnected AI systems. Current safety checks may miss these latent threats transmitted through semantically neutral data.

Method: Systematic study using teacher-student setup with GPT-2 to analyze scaling laws, thresholds, and mechanisms of subliminal corruption. Experiments include interpretability analysis to understand the corruption process.

Result: Three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes behavioral crossover degrading overall alignment; (2) alignment fails in sharp phase transitions at critical poisoned data thresholds rather than gradual degradation; (3) corruption mechanism mimics natural fine-tuning process, making detection difficult.

Conclusion: Subliminal corruption represents a critical vulnerability in AI systems relying on synthetic data, highlighting the need for new safety protocols that can account for these latent threats that bypass standard safety checks.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

### [27] [Feature Space Adaptation for Robust Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19155)
*Peng Wang,Minghao Gu,Qiang Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes feature space adaptation methods (LoRFA and VeFA) to address catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning by preserving pre-trained knowledge and improving robustness under distribution shifts, achieving comparable performance to weight-space methods like LoRA with better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and overwriting of pre-trained knowledge during fine-tuning, especially when downstream data is limited or differs significantly from pre-training distribution, by moving adaptation from weight space to feature space.

Method: Proposes two feature space adaptation methods: LoRFA (Low-Rank Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation), which compensate for downstream lurking variables via lightweight feature-level transformations based on effect equivalence modeling.

Result: Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results to LoRA on image classification, NLU, and NLG tasks, while demonstrating consistently stronger robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Feature space adaptation effectively preserves pre-trained representations and improves model generalization, offering a robust alternative to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods that operate in weight space.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new approach to linear partial monitoring with adversarial losses, using an exploration-by-optimization method that achieves efficient implementation and improved regret bounds that transparently depend on game structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classic partial monitoring by extending it to infinite outcome spaces through linear structures, while providing more transparent regret bounds that better reflect the alignment between observations and losses.

Method: Uses a simple instance of the exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient implementation for nonstochastic linear partial monitoring with finite actions.

Result: Derived regret bounds that achieve √T rate in locally observable games and T^{2/3} rate in globally observable games, with instance-specific quantities that reflect observation-loss alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides tight dependence on game structure in various partial information settings, achieving optimal rates and transparent theoretical guarantees that resemble known stochastic setting results.

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A vision-language model using Qwen2.5-VL is developed to classify mouse behaviors from videos, generating behavioral vectors over time without fine-tuning through prompts, in-context learning, and frame preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve scientific explorations by integrating diverse data, specifically enabling interdisciplinary researchers to study mouse behavior by creating comprehensive behavioral datasets from video analysis.

Method: Uses Qwen2.5-VL vision-language model with prompts, in-context learning using labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing to classify mouse behaviors from videos without model fine-tuning.

Result: The model achieves strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like freezing and fleeing, and produces behavioral vectors over time for each subject and session with high accuracy and minimal user input.

Conclusion: This vision-language model successfully supports interdisciplinary mouse behavior research by enabling integration of diverse behavioral features across multiple time points and environments into comprehensive datasets for complex research questions.

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

*Fangyuan Sun,Ilyas Fatkhullin,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis of Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) for non-conjugate likelihoods, establishing convergence guarantees and revealing hidden convexity properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite NGVI's empirical success in variational inference, its theoretical foundations remain limited for non-conjugate likelihoods where the variational loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze.

Method: Focus on mean-field parameterization, derive conditions for relative smoothness, propose modified NGVI with non-Euclidean projections, and analyze hidden convexity properties under structural assumptions.

Result: Established sufficient conditions for relative smoothness, proved global non-asymptotic convergence to stationary points, and demonstrated fast global convergence to optimum under additional structural assumptions.

Conclusion: The results provide new insights into the geometry and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging non-conjugate inference settings, advancing theoretical understanding beyond existing conjugate model guarantees.

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

### [31] [Imbalanced Gradients in RL Post-Training of Multi-Task LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19178)
*Runzhe Wu,Ankur Samanta,Ayush Jain,Scott Fujimoto,Jeongyeol Kwon,Ben Kretzu,Youliang Yu,Kaveh Hassani,Boris Vidolov,Yonathan Efroni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies gradient imbalance in multi-task RL post-training of LLMs, where certain tasks produce much larger gradients than others, biasing optimization. However, larger gradients don't necessarily lead to better learning gains, suggesting naive dataset mixing is problematic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-task post-training assumes all tasks contribute similar gradient magnitudes, but this assumption fails in RL post-training where gradient imbalances bias optimization toward certain tasks without corresponding performance benefits.

Method: The authors analyze gradient magnitudes across different tasks during RL post-training, comparing gradient sizes with actual learning gains (performance improvements), and examine whether training statistics like rewards or advantages can explain the imbalances.

Result: Large-gradient tasks don't necessarily achieve better learning gains than small-gradient ones - they can achieve similar or even lower performance improvements. Gradient imbalances can't be explained by typical training statistics, suggesting they arise from inherent task differences.

Conclusion: Naive dataset mixing in multi-task RL post-training is problematic due to gradient imbalances that bias optimization without performance justification. The paper calls for principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

### [32] [A Communication-Efficient Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19199)
*Xiaoxing Ren,Nicola Bastianello,Thomas Parisini,Andreas A. Malikopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a decentralized actor-critic framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning with limited communication, where agents perform local updates before exchanging information to reduce communication burden while maintaining coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of communication limitations in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems, where frequent communication can be costly or impractical.

Method: Developed a decentralized actor-critic learning framework where each agent performs multiple local updates of policy and value function (approximated by neural networks) before communicating with neighbors.

Result: Established finite-time convergence with sample complexity of O(ε⁻³) and communication complexity of O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹), where τ is local training steps. Numerical experiments validated theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces communication burden while maintaining coordination, with theoretical guarantees on convergence and complexity bounds.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

### [33] [An Active Diffusion Neural Network for Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19202)
*Mengying Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADGNN introduces active diffusion with external information sources to overcome over-smoothing in GNNs, enabling infinite diffusion while preserving node uniqueness and capturing global graph structure effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion-based GNNs suffer from over-smoothing and limited global information capture due to passive heat diffusion, inspired by the heat death concept where node representations converge to identical features without external input.

Method: Proposes Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN) that integrates multiple external information sources to dynamically influence diffusion, and calculates closed-form solution of active diffusion iterative formula for true infinite diffusion.

Result: ADGNN significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art GNN models across various graph tasks, demonstrating effective global information capture while maintaining node distinctiveness.

Conclusion: ADGNN successfully addresses over-smoothing in GNNs through active diffusion with external information, enabling nodes to preserve unique characteristics while gaining comprehensive global graph insights.

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a collaborative learning framework for graph neural networks (GNNs) where ensembles of student models mutually teach each other, departing from traditional knowledge distillation that requires a pre-trained teacher model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient model deployment on resource-constrained devices without requiring pre-trained teacher models, by allowing simple GNN architectures to learn collaboratively and perform better on multiple tasks.

Method: A collaborative learning framework with adaptive logit weighting unit for efficient knowledge exchange and entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning among student GNN ensembles.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets each for node and graph classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing improved performance during inference.

Conclusion: Collaborative learning among GNNs without pre-trained teachers can produce efficient models that outperform traditional approaches, particularly for multiple tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [35] [Controllable Machine Unlearning via Gradient Pivoting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19226)
*Youngsik Hwang,Dong-Young Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine unlearning is reframed as a multi-objective optimization problem to address trade-offs between unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. The proposed CUP algorithm uses a pivoting gradient mechanism to navigate the Pareto frontier, controlled by a single hyperparameter called 'unlearning intensity'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Approximate unlearning methods face critical trade-offs between unlearning efficacy and model fidelity, leading to challenges like over-forgetting, lack of fine-grained control, and absence of holistic evaluation metrics.

Method: The paper introduces Controllable Unlearning by Pivoting Gradient (CUP), a novel algorithm that reframes machine unlearning as multi-objective optimization. CUP features a unique pivoting mechanism that navigates the entire Pareto frontier using a single hyperparameter called 'unlearning intensity'.

Result: Experimental results show that CUP produces superior sets of Pareto-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms existing methods across various vision tasks, as evaluated using the hypervolume indicator metric.

Conclusion: Reframing machine unlearning as multi-objective optimization with the CUP algorithm provides fine-grained control over the unlearning process, addresses the efficacy-fidelity trade-off, and enables holistic evaluation through Pareto frontier navigation.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

TL;DR: Configurations is a brain-inspired clustering framework that achieves hierarchical organization, novelty detection, and adaptive learning using attraction-repulsion dynamics and a single resolution parameter, performing competitively on clustering tasks while modeling early cognitive categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a machine learning approach that mimics how infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts without supervision - capabilities that current ML systems struggle with.

Method: Configurations framework uses finite-resolution clustering with a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion dynamics to create hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible adaptation. Evaluation uses mheatmap with proportional heatmaps and reassignment algorithm for multi-resolution and dynamic behavior assessment.

Result: Competitive performance on standard clustering metrics across datasets, 87% AUC in novelty detection, and 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution compared to other methods.

Conclusion: Configurations represents a principled computational model of early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired artificial intelligence that can learn and adapt like infants.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how subtle design choices in time series foundation models (TSFMs) create implicit biases that affect model behavior, rather than proposing a new model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how various training process "knobs" affect model quality in TSFMs, instead of just claiming superiority through benchmarks.

Method: Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical evaluation to examine design choices like patch size, embedding choice, and training objectives.

Result: Identified that design choices lead to implicit biases in fundamental model properties including temporal behavior, geometric structure, and regression to mean tendencies.

Conclusion: Multiple biases can interact complexly, and understanding these effects has implications for learning the "bitter lesson" and building better TSFMs.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

TL;DR: SPOT is a novel method for computing interpretable decision tree policies in MDPs using mixed-integer linear programming with a reduced-space branch-and-bound approach, achieving significant speedup and scalability while maintaining policy quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes decision-making, but optimizing decision tree policies in MDPs remains challenging.

Method: Formulates the optimization problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and employs a reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples MDP dynamics from tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search.

Result: Achieves substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with significantly higher number of states. Produces interpretable and compact decision tree policies without compromising performance.

Conclusion: SPOT simultaneously achieves interpretability and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches.

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster

TL;DR: SILVER with RL-guided labeling extends the original SILVER framework to handle multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating RL policy outputs into boundary point identification, improving interpretability while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep reinforcement learning lacks interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. Existing SILVER framework is restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains.

Method: Extracts compact feature representations from image observations, performs SHAP-based feature attribution, employs RL-guided labeling to generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets, and trains surrogate models like decision trees and regression functions.

Result: Maintains competitive task performance while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent behavior in Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms.

Conclusion: Transforms SILVER into a scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in high-dimensional, multi-action settings, advancing explainable RL.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

TL;DR: GraMixC is a plug-and-play module that extracts hierarchical clustering configurations from Vision Transformers, aligns them using RMS technique, and fuses them via attention heads to improve downstream prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To emulate human cognitive ability of grouping objects by similarity and address limitations of register tokens in Vision Transformers, which exhibit redundancy and require ad hoc selection.

Method: Formally characterize hierarchical clustering configurations, introduce GraMixC module that extracts configurations, aligns them using Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via attention heads before downstream prediction.

Result: On DSN1 16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves R2 score from 0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting new state of the art. Consistently outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines on standard tabular benchmarks.

Conclusion: GraMixC effectively extracts and utilizes hierarchical clustering configurations to significantly improve prediction performance across various tasks, demonstrating the value of multi-resolution feature representations.

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

TL;DR: FnRGNN is a fairness-aware framework for GNN-based node regression that addresses fairness at three levels: structure, representation, and prediction, achieving reduced group disparities without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness approaches in GNNs mainly focus on classification tasks and representation-level debiasing, which are inadequate for continuous node-level regression problems.

Method: Multi-level intervention framework including structure-level edge reweighting, representation-level alignment using MMD, and prediction-level normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching.

Result: Experiments on four real-world datasets show that FnRGNN effectively reduces group disparities while maintaining model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-level fairness intervention strategy provides robust fairness guarantees for GNN-based node regression tasks under complex graph topologies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: QiMeng-SALV introduces signal-aware learning for Verilog code generation by leveraging functionally correct output signal segments to optimize RL training, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 7B model matching much larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of meaningful functional rewards hinders preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning for producing functionally correct Verilog code in automated circuit design.

Method: Extracts verified signal-aware implementations from partially incorrect modules by comparing functional correctness of signals with reference modules, uses AST to identify signal-aware code segments, and introduces signal-aware DPO optimized on correct signal-level code segments.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmarks, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming CodeV trained on the same dataset.

Conclusion: The method enables a paradigm shift from module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog code generation, effectively addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog

on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading

*Mingyu Jo,Jaesik Yoon,Justin Deschenaux,Caglar Gulcehre,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Loopholing Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs) introduce a deterministic latent pathway to preserve distributional information during discrete diffusion sampling, overcoming the sampling wall problem and achieving substantial improvements in text generation quality and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models suffer from a sampling wall where categorical sampling collapses rich distributional information into one-hot vectors, preventing information propagation across steps and forcing subsequent steps to operate with limited information.

Method: Introduce Loopholing mechanism with a deterministic latent pathway to preserve distributional information, trained efficiently with self-conditioning strategy to create Loopholing Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs).

Result: LDDMs reduce generative perplexity by up to 61% over prior baselines, close/surpass the gap with autoregressive models, produce more coherent text, and improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks like Countdown and Game of 24.

Conclusion: Loopholing mitigates idle steps and oscillations in discrete diffusion models, providing a scalable path toward high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional species monitoring methods have limited coverage and completeness. Species Distribution Modelling helps address these gaps but needs improvement for better accuracy in biodiversity conservation.

Method: Applied deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from 'EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge'. Used data balancing, feature selection, and multimodal ensemble modeling integrating land cover, NDVI, and environmental inputs.

Result: Data balancing reduced MAE from 189 to 29 in frog counting. Multimodal ensemble model outperformed individual models with 84.9% accuracy and AUC of 0.90. Feature selection identified key environmental factors while maintaining predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques (balancing and imputation) significantly improve ecological modeling accuracy for sparse or incomplete data, enabling more precise and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and

TL;DR: The Ring-linear model series introduces hybrid architecture models (Ring-mini-linear-2.0 with 16B parameters and Ring-flash-linear-2.0 with 104B parameters) that combine linear and softmax attention to reduce inference costs by 90% compared to dense models and 50% compared to original Ring series, while achieving SOTA performance on complex reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high I/O and computational overhead in long-context inference scenarios by developing efficient hybrid attention architectures that significantly reduce inference costs while maintaining high performance.

Method: Developed a hybrid architecture integrating linear attention and softmax attention, systematically explored optimal ratios between attention mechanisms, and leveraged a self-developed high-performance FP8 operator library (linghe) to improve training efficiency by 50%.

Result: Achieved 90% reduction in inference cost compared to 32B parameter dense models and over 50% reduction compared to original Ring series. Models maintained SOTA performance across multiple complex reasoning benchmarks through stable and efficient reinforcement learning optimization.

Conclusion: The Ring-linear model series demonstrates that hybrid attention architectures can dramatically reduce inference costs while maintaining state-of-the-art performance, with the identified optimal model structure providing significant efficiency gains for long-context applications.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

*Alvaro Perez-Diaz,James C. Loach,Danielle E. Toutoungi,Lee Middleton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-series foundation models often produce limited forecast types (point or parametric), while operational tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. The paper establishes when forecast types can be converted and proves that marginals alone cannot determine path-dependent event probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time-series foundation models focus on forecast accuracy but overlook the practical utility of different forecast types. Many operational tasks require trajectory ensembles with temporal dependence, which most models don't provide.

Method: The authors survey recent TSFMs, establish conversion rules between forecast types, prove mathematical limitations of marginal distributions for path-dependent events, and map operational tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types.

Result: Two-thirds of surveyed TSFMs produce only point or parametric forecasts. The study shows trajectory ensembles can convert to simpler forms but not vice versa without additional assumptions, and marginals cannot determine path-dependent event probabilities.

Conclusion: Forecast type, not just accuracy, determines practical utility. The paper provides a task-aligned evaluation framework and clarifies when different forecast types are necessary for operational decision-making.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BBMDP, a principled MDP formulation for variable selection in Branch and Bound (B&B) algorithms for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), enabling the use of various RL algorithms to learn optimal branching heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variable selection heuristics significantly impact B&B solver performance in MILP problems. Existing RL approaches use ad hoc formulations, so the authors aim to create a principled MDP framework that can leverage standard RL algorithms.

Method: The authors propose BBMDP, a vanilla Markov Decision Process formulation specifically designed for variable selection in B&B algorithms. This formulation allows the application of a broad range of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn optimal branching policies.

Result: Computational experiments show that the proposed branching agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of the BBMDP formulation.

Conclusion: BBMDP provides a principled MDP framework for variable selection in B&B that successfully enables RL algorithms to learn optimal branching heuristics, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing RL approaches on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based inertial tracking systems are vulnerable to privacy breaches that expose sensitive training data, and existing differential privacy solutions often compromise model performance by introducing excessive noise in high-frequency inertial measurements.

Method: Proposes ConvXformer hybrid architecture fusing ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in hierarchical structure, with efficient differential privacy mechanism using adaptive gradient clipping and gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI), and truncated singular value decomposition for gradient processing.

Conclusion: The framework provides secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical systems with precise control over privacy-utility trade-off and demonstrated robustness under challenging environmental conditions.

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive

differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value

accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical

*Guus Toussaint,Arno Knobbe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to extract monotonic proxies for system 'age' from multi-variate time series data by discovering functions of sensors that show strong monotonic behavior over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many systems age or degrade over time, but available sensors may not directly measure this 'age'. The goal is to find latent features that can serve as reliable proxies for system aging when direct age measurements are unavailable.

Method: Uses a defined grammar to generate candidate equations from sensor data, then optimizes them for monotonicity using absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time and candidate formulas. The approach assesses and selects features based on their monotonic behavior.

Result: The method successfully combines sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high monotonicity. In the InfraWatch dataset, two features with individual Spearman's ρ values of 0.13 and 0.09 were combined into a proxy with ρ of 0.95.

Conclusion: The proposed approach can discover interpretable equations that effectively serve as proxies for system 'age', demonstrating the ability to extract meaningful latent features from multi-variate time series data.

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

*Yuhang Liu,Minglai Shao,Zengyi Wo,Yunlong Chu,Bing Hao,Shengzhong Liu,Ruijie Wang,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAligner is a dynamic graph-text alignment framework that adaptively switches between many-to-many and one-to-one alignment strategies based on real-time supervision quality assessment, addressing limitations of existing CLIP-style aligners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-text aligners assume strict one-to-one correspondences and use static alignment objectives, which fail to handle real-world many-to-many relations and are brittle under noisy supervision. This creates a dilemma where expressive alignment amplifies noise while conservative alignment sacrifices semantic diversity.

Method: ADAligner dynamically estimates batch-level alignment reliability and adapts optimization accordingly. It promotes soft subgraph-level many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, and emphasizes reliable one-to-one alignment by filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.

Result: ADAligner consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval across nine diverse TAG datasets. It maintains strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by 2-3 times compared to multimodal baselines.

Conclusion: ADAligner establishes a scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in real-world web environments by providing a theoretically stable dynamic alignment mechanism that adapts to varying data quality conditions.

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CPSVD is a novel SVD-based LLM compression method that intelligently segments parameter matrices, preserving high-error columns directly and applying SVD only to low-error columns, while adaptively allocating non-uniform compression rates across different modules within layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SVD-based LLM compression methods treat parameter matrices uniformly, ignoring significant variations in SVD approximation errors across different matrix parts, leading to suboptimal compression performance.

Method: CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with high decomposition errors, applies SVD only to columns with low decomposition errors, and adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to different modules within layers while maintaining target layer-wise compression ratios.

Result: Extensive experiments show CPSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods, achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: CPSVD provides a more effective approach to LLM compression by addressing the heterogeneity in decomposition errors across parameter matrices, offering superior performance compared to uniform SVD-based methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

### [54] [ARA: Adaptive Rank Allocation for Efficient Large Language Model SVD Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19389)
*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptive Rank Allocation (ARA), a method that improves SVD-based LLM compression by introducing a dedicated mask design and additional loss function to achieve better rank allocation across linear modules under global compression constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SVD-based LLM compression methods have limitations: heuristic algorithms explore restricted solution spaces, mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture relationships between singular value spectra and parameters, and current methods overlook the non-smooth gain function property at compression ratio 1, leading to suboptimal local minima.

Method: ARA introduces (1) a dedicated mask design for efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable parameters, and (2) an additional loss function to guide parameter selection toward globally optimal solutions.

Result: On LLaMA2-7B with 80% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42 and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared to uniform compression.

Conclusion: ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance in SVD-based LLM compression by effectively addressing rank allocation challenges through its novel mask design and optimization approach.

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address spectral bias - the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency features first - which limits the performance of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) on high-frequency PDE problems.

Method: Proposes iterative training with Fourier-enhanced features using Random Fourier Features to enrich the latent space. Creates a two-stage training: (i) estimate basis in feature space, and (ii) perform regression to determine coefficients of enhanced basis functions.

Result: For linear models, the regression problem is convex and the iterative training scheme converges. Random Fourier Features enhance expressive capacity, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Extensive numerical evaluation shows superior performance over state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN effectively overcomes spectral bias in PINNs through Fourier feature enhancement, providing improved approximation across the frequency domain and better performance on high-frequency PDE problems.

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

Motivation: Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static correction strategies, struggle with data sparsity in minority groups, and have suboptimal utilization of sensitive attributes - either depending too much on complete labeling or ignoring them entirely.

Method: FairNet combines a bias detector with conditional low-rank adaptation (LoRA) that activates fairness correction only for biased instances. It uses a novel contrastive loss function to minimize intra-class representation disparities across sensitive groups and address underfitting in minority groups.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows FairNet can enhance worst-group performance without diminishing overall model performance, potentially yielding slight improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across vision and language benchmarks validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: FairNet provides a flexible framework for fairness correction that can handle scenarios with complete, partial, or absent sensitive attribute labels, offering dynamic instance-level correction while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

### [57] [LLM Unlearning with LLM Beliefs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19422)
*Kemou Li,Qizhou Wang,Yue Wang,Fengpeng Li,Jun Liu,Bo Han,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a 'squeezing effect' in LLM unlearning where probability mass redistributes to semantically related rephrasings, proposes a bootstrapping framework that suppresses both target responses and model beliefs to achieve more thorough forgetting while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning methods using gradient ascent cause probability mass to redistribute to high-likelihood regions (squeezing effect), leading to spurious unlearning where semantically related rephrasings of targets remain accessible.

Method: Proposes a bootstrapping (BS) framework that explicitly links squeezing effect with model's high-confidence generations (model beliefs). BS-T suppresses high-probability tokens while BS-S removes entire high-confidence generations, jointly suppressing both target responses and model beliefs.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of the approach in achieving more thorough forgetting while preserving utility.

Conclusion: The bootstrapping framework successfully addresses the squeezing effect in LLM unlearning by incorporating model beliefs into the unlearning objective, providing more comprehensive forgetting of sensitive content without compromising model utility.

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

TL;DR: NVDPs is a Bayesian meta-learning method that uses task-specific dropout with a low-rank Bernoulli model for efficient few-shot learning, enabling quick adaptation of shared neural networks to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust meta-learning approach that can effectively infer conditional posterior distributions for few-shot learning tasks by modeling task-specific uncertainties.

Method: Uses Neural Variational Dropout Processes with task-specific dropout and a low-rank product of Bernoulli experts meta-model for memory-efficient mapping. Employs amortized variational inference with a novel prior conditioned on task data.

Result: NVDPs showed excellent performance in few-shot learning tasks including 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification, outperforming other meta-learning approaches.

Conclusion: NVDPs provide a robust Bayesian meta-learning framework that effectively handles functional ambiguities and uncertainties in few-shot learning through task-specific dropout modeling.

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

TL;DR: The paper revisits the modified universality hypothesis, finding that while representational similarity exists in specific settings, predictive behavior doesn't converge with increasing robustness and results vary across datasets, suggesting only partial universality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the generality of the modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) which suggests that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.

Method: Revisiting and testing the universality hypothesis across different datasets, analyzing representational similarity and predictive behavior convergence with increasing robustness.

Result: While high representational similarity was verified in specific settings, results were inconsistent across datasets. Predictive behavior did not converge with increasing robustness, with differing predictions originating in the classification layer. Simple retraining of classifiers achieved more universal predictive behavior.

Conclusion: The work points towards partial universality of neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict universality.

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: g-DPO is a scalable framework that accelerates Direct Preference Optimization for protein language models by clustering sequences to prune redundant training pairs and using group-based approximations to amortize likelihood computations, achieving similar performance with 1.8-3.7x faster convergence.


<details>

Motivation: Standard DPO faces scalability issues as the number of training pairs grows quadratically with labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive training times even for modest datasets.

Method: Uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs while preserving training signal, and amortizes likelihood computations with group-based approximations.

Result: Maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance statistically indistinguishable from standard DPO across three protein engineering tasks, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster.

Conclusion: g-DPO provides an effective solution to DPO's scalability bottleneck, with greater efficiency gains expected for larger datasets.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

*Julian Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a safety framework using chain-of-thought monitoring to ensure AI safety when traditional safety cases become insufficient, addressing threats like neuralese and encoded reasoning while exploring techniques for maintaining faithful reasoning monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where traditional inability safety cases become insufficient, alternative approaches are needed to ensure safety.

Method: Proposes a two-part safety case: (1) establishing models lack dangerous capabilities without CoT, and (2) ensuring dangerous capabilities enabled by CoT are detectable by monitoring. Examines threats to monitorability (neuralese, encoded reasoning), evaluates techniques for maintaining CoT faithfulness, and explores extracting monitorable CoT from non-monitorable reasoning.

Result: Systematically categorizes threats into three forms (linguistic drift, steganography, alien reasoning) and analyzes their drivers. Establishes prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones influencing CoT monitoring feasibility.

Conclusion: CoT monitoring might support both control and trustworthiness safety cases, providing a viable alternative approach to AI safety when traditional methods become insufficient.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

*Qiang Chen,Zhongze Wu,Ang He,Xi Lin,Shuo Jiang,Shan You,Chang Xu,Yi Chen,Xiu Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: INPO is an influence-aware negative preference optimization framework for graph unlearning that slows divergence speed and maintains model utility by targeting high-influence edges and using topological entropy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph unlearning models using gradient ascent on forget sets cause rapid utility degradation due to fast divergence speed during unlearning.

Method: INPO uses influence-aware message functions to amplify unlearned edge influence, estimates edge influence via removal-based methods, and applies topological entropy loss to preserve local structure.

Result: Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show INPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on forget quality metrics while maintaining model utility.

Conclusion: INPO successfully addresses the utility degradation problem in graph unlearning by slowing divergence speed and improving model robustness through influence-aware optimization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELUTQ is an efficient quantization framework using Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ) to enable high-performance LLM deployment on CPU-based edge devices, reducing memory usage and latency while eliminating dequantization overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs on CPU-based edge devices is challenging due to limited memory and computational resources. Existing uniform quantization methods poorly fit weight distributions and incur high dequantization overhead at low bit widths.

Method: Proposes ELUTQ framework with Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ) format that captures weight statistics without increasing computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations. Provides optimized CPU kernels for end-to-end inference.

Result: For LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces perplexity by ~8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training quantization. With finetuning, further improves 2-bit performance. Achieves >25 tokens/s on Apple M2 chip with 2-bit LLaMA2-7B.

Conclusion: ELUTQ effectively addresses edge deployment challenges by eliminating dequantization overhead while maintaining high performance at low bit widths, enabling efficient LLM inference on CPU-based edge devices.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpikeQuant is a brain-inspired quantization method that enables energy-efficient LLM deployment by converting activations to binary spikes and embedding quantization scales into IF thresholds, achieving near-FP16 performance with 4.6x energy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three key challenges in LLM quantization: MAC operations dominating energy consumption, dequantization overhead, and impractical mixed-precision implementation on current hardware, while leveraging SNNs' energy-efficient properties.

Method: Selectively applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values, re-encodes them into binary spike counts, and embeds quantization scale into IF mechanism thresholds to avoid explicit dequantization.

Result: Consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SpikeQuant provides an effective approach for accurate and energy-efficient LLM deployment by combining mixed-precision quantization with spiking neural network principles.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: Multi-model consistency methods outperform single-model approaches for LLM hallucination detection and mitigation, offering better performance with reduced inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-model consistency methods have limitations due to training data biases and under-representation. Combining multiple LLMs with different training data, schemes, and architectures can overcome these limitations.

Method: Extend single-model consistency to consortium consistency by aggregating responses from multiple LLMs (15 models tested) with diverse training backgrounds and architectures.

Result: Substantial improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation capabilities beyond single-model approaches, often with reduced inference costs.

Conclusion: Multi-model consortium consistency is more effective than single-model approaches for hallucination detection and mitigation, providing performance gains while addressing cost concerns.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

Conclusion: Establishes design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems and provides foundation for interactive explanation platforms suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional two-stage ML-OR pipelines suffer from prediction-decision misalignment and bias-variance dilemmas, where ML focuses on prediction accuracy without considering downstream optimization, and observational data contains biases while experimental data is scarce and costly.

Method: Develops an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using experimental data, creates surrogate loss functions to bridge discrete optimization gradients, and establishes a bi-level optimization framework solved via implicit differentiation that jointly leverages both observational and experimental data.

Result: Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with successful deployment at Meituan.

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL effectively addresses fundamental challenges in marketing resource allocation by enabling unbiased OR estimators to correct learning directions from biased observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff and superior decision quality.

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks confirm superior performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: REBMBO effectively overcomes limitations of traditional Bayesian Optimization methods by combining local GP guidance with global EBM structural information and adaptive multi-step lookahead via PPO, demonstrating improved performance and robustness.

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive

Motivation: AI methods in drug discovery rely on public datasets lacking scale and diversity of proprietary pharmaceutical data, while federated learning offers privacy-preserving collaborative training but complicates data-centric tasks like diversity estimation and chemical space analysis.

Method: Benchmarked three federated clustering approaches (Federated kMeans, Federated PCA + Federated kMeans, Federated Locality-Sensitive Hashing) against centralized counterparts on eight diverse molecular datasets, using both standard mathematical metrics and a novel chemistry-informed metric (SF-ICF).

Result: Large-scale benchmarking with in-depth explainability analysis showed the importance of incorporating domain knowledge through chemistry-informed metrics and on-client explainability analyses for federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

Conclusion: Federated clustering methods can effectively disentangle and represent distributed molecular data, with chemistry-informed evaluation metrics and explainability analyses being crucial for meaningful diversity analysis in federated pharmaceutical applications.

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

*Jinpyo Hong,Rachel E. Baker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ForecastNet-XCL is a deep learning ensemble model (XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM) that creates accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100 weeks ahead using climate and temporal data without real-time surveillance, outperforming traditional methods across 34 U.S. states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While ML methods have shown value for epidemic forecasting (like COVID-19), their application to endemic disease forecasting remains underexplored, particularly for diseases like RSV where climate factors play a significant role.

Method: A hybrid deep learning framework combining XGBoost, CNN, and BiLSTM with high-resolution feature learning, long-range temporal dependency capturing, and an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations. Uses stochastic inference for probabilistic intervals.

Result: Reliably outperformed statistical baselines, individual neural networks, and conventional ensemble methods across 34 U.S. states in both within- and cross-state scenarios, maintaining accuracy over extended forecast horizons (up to 100 weeks).

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool for RSV forecasting, especially valuable amid increasing climate pressures and limited surveillance resources.

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

*Jin Han,Zhe Zheng,Yi Gu,Jia-Rui Lin,Xin-Zheng Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiffEvac is a novel method using Generative Models for efficient evacuation simulation, achieving 37.6% SSIM improvement and 16x faster results than traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evacuation simulation relies on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it challenging for rapid iteration in early design stages. This study aims to provide efficient evacuation simulation for enhanced safety design.

Method: The method involves: 1) Creating a dataset of 399 diverse building layouts and evacuation heatmaps, 2) Developing a decoupled feature representation for physical features, 3) Using a diffusion model based on image prompts to learn evacuation patterns from simulated heatmaps.

Result: DiffEvac achieves up to 37.6% improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster than existing Conditional GANs with RGB representation, reducing simulation time to 2 minutes.

Conclusion: The method significantly enhances rapid design iteration, lowers modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools for future safety optimization in intelligent building design.

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock the unfulfilled potential of least squares in modern machine learning by making it a differentiable operator that can be integrated as a neural network layer.

Method: Derive custom gradients to transform the least squares solver into a differentiable operator, enabling its use as a flexible component in various ML architectures.

Result: Successfully demonstrated three applications: enforcing weight sparsity on 50M parameter models, imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based generative models, and hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes.

Conclusion: The work advances differentiable linear-algebra tools and makes them accessible to ML practitioners, representing the next iteration in developing flexible mathematical operators for modern machine learning.

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

*Shashi Kumar,Yacouba Kaloga,John Mitros,Petr Motlicek,Ina Kodrasi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FVAE-LoRA improves standard LoRA by using a VAE to create two separate latent spaces - one for task-salient features and another for residual information - through a novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation that explicitly promotes factorization between these spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace, potentially limiting downstream performance.

Method: Proposes Factorized Variational Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA) which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct latent spaces with a novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation that explicitly promotes factorization between the latent spaces.

Result: Extensive experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Spurious correlation evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals, leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA effectively separates task-salient features from residual information through factorized latent spaces, resulting in superior performance and robustness compared to standard LoRA across multiple domains.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

*Konstantin Hess,Dennis Frauen,Mihaela van der Schaar,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal meta-learner for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in time-varying settings, addressing severe overlap problems where existing methods suffer from exploding variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meta-learners for time-varying heterogeneous treatment effects assume adequate treatment overlap, but real data often has little support for plausible treatment sequences, causing severe overlap problems and exploding estimation variance.

Method: Developed a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal meta-learner that targets regions with high probability of receiving interventional treatment sequences, using a Neyman-orthogonal population risk function that minimizes overlap-weighted oracle risk.

Result: The WO-learner demonstrates robustness against nuisance function misspecification, is fully model-agnostic, and shows improved performance in experiments with transformer and LSTM backbones compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed overlap-weighted orthogonal meta-learner effectively addresses overlap problems in time-varying HTE estimation, providing more reliable estimates while being robust and model-agnostic.

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

TL;DR: TraDy is a memory-efficient transfer learning method that uses dynamic stochastic channel selection in preselected layers to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As deep neural networks grow larger and deployment environments impose strict resource constraints, there is a need for memory-efficient training methods that can reduce computational overhead without sacrificing model performance.

Method: TraDy leverages two key insights: layer importance for updates is architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, and dynamic stochastic channel selection provides superior gradient approximation. The method introduces dynamic channel selection that stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative computation.

Conclusion: TraDy provides an effective transfer learning scheme that significantly reduces memory usage and computational costs while maintaining competitive performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained deployment environments.

### [77] [Fast Inference via Hierarchical Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19705)
*Amir Globerson,Haim Kaplan,Yishay Mansour,Clara Mohri,Tal Schuster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) is a new algorithm that stacks multiple draft models in a hierarchy to reduce inference latency in transformer language models, achieving up to 1.2x speed-up over single-draft baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding uses a single draft model, but there may exist multiple draft models with different speed-accuracy tradeoffs. HSD aims to leverage this hierarchy of draft models to further reduce generation latency beyond what's possible with a single draft model.

Method: HSD stacks draft models into a hierarchy where each model proposes tokens and the next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, with the target model performing the final verification. The algorithm includes deriving expressions for expected latency and polynomial-time selection of optimal hierarchies.

Result: Empirical results show HSD provides up to 1.2x speed-up over the best single-draft baseline, demonstrating practical latency reduction beyond previous techniques.

Conclusion: Hierarchical Speculative Decoding effectively reduces transformer language model inference latency by leveraging multiple draft models in a hierarchical verification structure, with polynomial-time optimization for selecting the optimal hierarchy configuration.

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

*Hui He,Kun Yi,Yuanchi Ma,Qi Zhang,Zhendong Niu,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEMPO is a lightweight foundation model for time series forecasting that achieves strong generalization with reduced pre-training data and model size through energy-aware spectral decomposition and mixture-of-prompts transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the tension between versatility and affordability in time series foundation models, as current models require massive architectures and large-scale pre-training, hindering deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: 1) Energy-aware spectral decomposition module that models both high-energy and low-energy frequency signals; 2) Mixture-of-Prompts enabled Transformer that learns heterogeneous temporal patterns through dataset-specific prompts and adaptively routes tokens to prompt-based experts.

Result: Extensive experiments on 16 datasets across two large-scale benchmarks show superior performance in zero-shot and few-shot forecasting scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing pre-training data scale and model size.

Conclusion: SEMPO successfully bridges the gap between versatility and affordability in time series foundation models, achieving strong generalization with lightweight architecture and reduced pre-training requirements.

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available

TL;DR: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff framework uses synthetic ICU time-series data for training and trustworthy evaluation of predictive models across demographic subgroups, reducing TRTS gap by 70% while maintaining training utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable trustworthy, granular model evaluation in critical care without exposing sensitive EHR data, providing privacy-preserving robust performance analysis across diverse patient populations.

Method: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff augments latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties, building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff, HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff).

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces TRTS gap by over 70% (ΔTRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC) while preserving training utility (ΔTSTR ≈ 0.01). For 32 intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50% and outperform small real test sets in 72-84% of subgroups.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical, privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

TL;DR: BATIS is a Bayesian deep learning framework that improves species distribution models by iteratively updating prior predictions with limited observational data, effectively handling both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to enhance reliability in data-scarce locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning species distribution models (SDMs) are limited by spatial biases in data and struggle to effectively combine local insights with broader ecological patterns due to inadequate uncertainty quantification.

Method: Proposed BATIS framework using Bayesian deep learning that iteratively updates prior predictions with limited observational data, with extensive benchmarking of uncertainty quantification approaches on eBird citizen science data.

Result: Bayesian deep learning approaches significantly improve SDM reliability in data-scarce locations by effectively capturing both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.

Conclusion: Bayesian deep learning can greatly enhance the reliability of species distribution models, contributing to better ecological understanding and conservation efforts, particularly in areas with limited observational data.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

*Qilin Ye,Deqing Fu,Robin Jia,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms and instead rely on brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, the paper shows that an L-layer Transformer can solve graphs with diameters up to 3^L, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the adjacency matrix. Training dynamics depend on whether most training instances are within this capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms and instead rely on brittle heuristics, using graph connectivity as a concrete testbed to analyze this phenomenon both theoretically and empirically.

Method: The paper uses a simplified Transformer architecture called the disentangled Transformer, and proves that an L-layer model can solve graphs with diameters up to exactly 3^L. It analyzes training dynamics and shows the learned strategy depends on whether training instances are within model capacity.

Result: Within-capacity graphs (diameter ≤ 3^L) drive learning of correct algorithmic solutions, while beyond-capacity graphs drive learning of simple heuristics based on node degrees. Empirically, restricting training data within model capacity leads to both standard and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than degree-based heuristics.

Conclusion: The capacity of Transformers to learn generalizable algorithms depends critically on whether training data falls within their theoretical capacity bounds. When trained on within-capacity instances, Transformers can learn exact algorithms, but beyond-capacity training leads to heuristic-based solutions.

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

TL;DR: CONFEX generates uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using Conformal Prediction and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming to provide local coverage guarantees and avoid regions of high predictive uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanation methods often neglect predictive uncertainty or lack principled mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees, which can lead to misleading or inapplicable explanations.

Method: CONFEX uses a novel localized Conformal Prediction procedure with efficient MILP encoding by leveraging offline tree-based partitioning of the input space, generating CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty and optimality.

Result: Evaluation against state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmarks and metrics demonstrates that CONFEX's uncertainty-aware approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

Conclusion: CONFEX provides a principled framework for generating counterfactual explanations with formal guarantees on uncertainty avoidance and optimality, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from prohibitive computational overhead and latency due to multi-step iterations and complex backbone networks, creating bottlenecks for real-time applications. Existing acceleration techniques face limitations in applicability, training costs, or quality degradation.

Method: Diffusion Caching identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process through feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, without modifying model parameters. It evolves from static reuse to dynamic prediction approaches.

Result: The paradigm reduces computation without quality degradation, enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks, and enables integration with other acceleration techniques like sampling optimization and model distillation.

Conclusion: Diffusion Caching will become a key enabler for real-time and efficient generative AI, providing a unified inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications, injecting new vitality into Efficient Generative Intelligence theory and practice.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

TL;DR: A novel method to estimate model vulnerability to membership inference attacks without requiring computationally expensive reference models, using loss distribution analysis to predict risk from training and testing data alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art membership inference attacks require training numerous reference models, which is computationally expensive and limits practical application. There's a need for more efficient vulnerability assessment methods.

Method: Analyzes loss distribution asymmetry and heavy tails, noting that vulnerable points shift from high-loss to low-loss regions after training. Uses absence of outliers from high-loss region as predictor of risk, specifically using TNR of simple loss attack to estimate vulnerability.

Result: The method accurately estimates model-level vulnerability to state-of-the-art MIA attacks (LiRA) across various architectures and datasets, outperforms low-cost attacks like RMIA and other distribution difference measures, and shows promise for evaluating risk in large-language models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient alternative to reference model-based attacks for assessing membership inference vulnerability, with demonstrated effectiveness across diverse model architectures and potential applicability to large language models.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

*Anand Choudhary,Yasser Sulaıman,Lukas Mauch,Ghouthi Boukli Hacene,Fabien Cardinaux,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLLoP is a sparse fine-tuning method that selectively tunes parameters with large gradients on downstream tasks but small pre-trained magnitudes, balancing task relevance with minimal disruption to pre-trained knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse fine-tuning methods for LLMs depend on optimal parameter selection, and there's a need for techniques that effectively balance task adaptation with preservation of pre-trained knowledge.

Method: GaLLoP fine-tunes parameters based on two criteria: largest gradient magnitudes on downstream tasks (indicating task relevance) and smallest pre-trained parameter magnitudes (minimizing disruption to existing knowledge).

Result: Experiments with LLaMA3 8B and Gemma 2B show GaLLoP matches or improves performance over LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, while reducing catastrophic forgetting and task data memorization.

Conclusion: GaLLoP provides stable, robust performance across random seeds by preserving important pre-trained parameters and effectively balancing task adaptation with knowledge retention.

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

### [86] [Environment Inference for Learning Generalizable Dynamical System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19784)
*Shixuan Liu,Yue He,Haotian Wang,Wenjing Yang,Yunfei Wang,Peng Cui,Zhong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaInfer is a novel method that infers environment specifications from prediction errors of fixed neural networks, enabling environment assignments without requiring environment labels during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven methods for dynamical systems assume IID data and rely on environment labels for generalization, but these labels are often unavailable due to data acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability in large datasets.

Method: DynaInfer analyzes prediction errors from fixed neural networks within each training round to infer environment specifications, enabling environment assignments directly from data without requiring environment labels.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse dynamical systems show that DynaInfer outperforms existing environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and achieves superior performance even when environment labels are available.

Conclusion: DynaInfer effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in unlabeled scenarios and provides a robust solution for handling environmental differences in dynamical systems without requiring environment labels.

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

### [87] [Blackbox Model Provenance via Palimpsestic Membership Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19796)
*Rohith Kuditipudi,Jing Huang,Sally Zhu,Diyi Yang,Christopher Potts,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to detect if a blackbox language model derivative is using Alice's original model by testing for statistical dependencies with Alice's randomized training data order, achieving significant p-values in query settings and requiring varying amounts of text in observational settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable Alice to prove that Bob is using her open-weight language model derivative without direct access, by leveraging the concept of palimpsestic memorization where models memorize data seen later in training.

Method: Formulates the problem as independence testing using training data order correlation. In query setting: estimates likelihoods of Bob's model on Alice's training examples and correlates with training order. In observational setting: uses text overlap with training spans and likelihood comparisons with retrained model versions.

Result: In query setting: achieved p-values ≤1e-8 for most of 40+ fine-tunes across Pythia and OLMo models (1B-12B parameters). In observational setting: second approach reliably detects with few hundred tokens; first approach requires hundreds of thousands of tokens for high power.

Conclusion: Training data order correlation provides quantifiable statistical evidence for model provenance, with effective detection in both query and observational settings, though observational detection requires different amounts of text depending on the approach.

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

### [88] [Transformers are almost optimal metalearners for linear classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19797)
*Roey Magen,Gal Vardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can function as near-optimal metalearners in linear classification, achieving generalization with O(k/R⁴) in-context examples after training on related tasks, significantly outperforming methods that only use in-context data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically analyze whether transformers can serve as metalearners that adapt to new tasks using only a few in-context examples, without additional training, in a formal metalearning setting.

Method: Analyze a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent on a family of tasks where each task is a class-conditional Gaussian mixture model with mean vectors in a shared k-dimensional subspace of R^d.

Result: After sufficient training, the transformer can generalize to new tasks using only O(k/R⁴) in-context examples, nearly matching the optimal learner that knows the shared subspace and significantly outperforming learners using only in-context data (which require Ω(d/R⁴) examples).

Conclusion: Transformers can indeed act as near-optimal metalearners, with training requirements independent of the ambient dimension d, demonstrating their strong in-context learning capabilities for metalearning.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

*Sandra Malagon,Monica A. Ulloa Ruiz,Tatiana Elizabeth Sandoval Plaza,Gabriel Rafael Rosario Bolívar,Valentina García Mesa,Ivanna Alvarado Morales*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in Brazil and Mexico under hardware, energy, and budget constraints, finding that H100-based configurations are more cost-effective than A100-based ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address structural asymmetries in AI capabilities between high-capacity jurisdictions and Global South countries by examining technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training.

Method: Uses a dual-axis design varying accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150 days) to estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures, and regulatory compatibility for training a 10-trillion-token model.

Result: All configurations remain below export-control and electrical infrastructure thresholds. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at 8-14 million USD total cost, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million USD due to higher energy and hardware demand.

Conclusion: Extending training timelines should be used as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints, enabling production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models without competing at the global frontier, contributing to sustainable AI capabilities in middle-income countries.

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

### [90] [Semantic World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19818)
*Jacob Berg,Chuning Zhu,Yanda Bao,Ishan Durugkar,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using vision language models as semantic world models instead of pixel-based world models for robotic planning, achieving better generalization by predicting task-relevant semantic information rather than reconstructing pixels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional world models that predict future pixels often don't correlate well with planning objectives, as strong pixel reconstruction doesn't guarantee good planning decisions. The authors want world models to focus on task-relevant semantic information instead.

Method: The paper frames world modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in future frames. Vision language models are trained as semantic world models through supervised finetuning on image-action-text data.

Result: The semantic world model approach enables planning for decision-making while inheriting generalization and robustness properties from pretrained vision-language models, leading to significant generalization improvements over reconstruction-based world modeling.

Conclusion: Semantic world models using vision language models outperform conventional pixel-based world models for robotic planning tasks, providing better generalization and alignment with actual planning objectives.

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

### [91] [Centered MA Dirichlet ARMA for Financial Compositions: Theory & Empirical Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18903)
*Harrison Katz*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a centered innovation approach for Dirichlet time series models to fix bias in moving-average terms, improving predictive performance while maintaining computational tractability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Dirichlet ARMA models using additive log-ratio residuals have biased moving-average regressors with nonzero conditional means, which biases mean paths and complicates interpretation of MA coefficients.

Method: Replace the raw ALR residual regressor with a centered innovation computed via digamma functions, which restores mean-zero innovations without changing the likelihood or ALR link structure.

Result: The centered formulation improves log predictive scores in bank asset composition forecasting with similar point errors and much cleaner Hamiltonian Monte Carlo diagnostics compared to the original raw-MA specification.

Conclusion: Centering innovations in Dirichlet time series models provides a minimal but effective fix that improves statistical properties and computational performance while maintaining model interpretability and closed-form solutions.

Abstract: Observation-driven Dirichlet models for compositional time series often use
the additive log-ratio (ALR) link and include a moving-average (MA) term built
from ALR residuals. In the standard B--DARMA recursion, the usual MA regressor
$\alr(\mathbf{Y}_t)-\boldsymbol{\eta}_t$ has nonzero conditional mean under the
Dirichlet likelihood, which biases the mean path and blurs the interpretation
of MA coefficients. We propose a minimal change: replace the raw regressor with
a \emph{centered} innovation
$\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_t^{\circ}=\alr(\mathbf{Y}_t)-\mathbb{E}\{\alr(\mathbf{Y}_t)\mid
\boldsymbol{\eta}_t,\phi_t\}$, computable in closed form via digamma functions.
Centering restores mean-zero innovations for the MA block without altering
either the likelihood or the ALR link. We provide simple identities for the
conditional mean and the forecast recursion, show first-order equivalence to a
digamma-link DARMA while retaining a closed-form inverse to
$\boldsymbol{\mu}_t$, and give ready-to-use code. A weekly application to the
Federal Reserve H.8 bank-asset composition compares the original (raw-MA) and
centered specifications under a fixed holdout and rolling one-step origins. The
centered formulation improves log predictive scores with essentially identical
point error and markedly cleaner Hamiltonian Monte Carlo diagnostics.

TL;DR: A data fusion framework for estimating causal dose-response functions using multiple partially-aligned data sources, featuring a Neyman-orthogonal loss function with stochastic approximation for computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single data sources are often insufficient to precisely estimate causal dose-response functions across all exposure levels, requiring integration of multiple data sources.

Method: Proposed a data fusion framework with Neyman-orthogonal loss function, stochastic approximation for computational efficiency, and kernel ridge regression with closed-form estimators.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows tighter finite-sample regret bounds and improved worst-case performance; simulations confirm improved estimation accuracy through data fusion.

Conclusion: Data fusion is effective for estimating non-smooth parameters like causal dose-response functions, with theoretical and empirical validation of its advantages.

Abstract: Estimating the causal dose-response function is challenging, particularly
when data from a single source are insufficient to estimate responses precisely
across all exposure levels. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data
fusion framework that leverages multiple data sources that are partially
aligned with the target distribution. Specifically, we derive a
Neyman-orthogonal loss function tailored for estimating the dose-response
function within data fusion settings. To improve computational efficiency, we
propose a stochastic approximation that retains orthogonality. We apply kernel
ridge regression with this approximation, which provides closed-form
estimators. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that incorporating additional
data sources yields tighter finite-sample regret bounds and improved worst-case
performance, as confirmed via minimax lower bound comparison. Simulation
studies validate the practical advantages of our approach, showing improved
estimation accuracy when employing data fusion. This study highlights the
potential of data fusion for estimating non-smooth parameters such as causal
dose-response functions.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Gaussian process-based modeling framework for clustering genes in spatial transcriptomics data, using spatial structure to inform precision matrices via generalized Cholesky decomposition to avoid kernel misspecification issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial transcriptomics preserves tissue spatial structure while measuring gene expression, enabling investigation of spatial variation. Identifying genes with similar expression profiles is crucial, motivating development of flexible clustering methods that leverage spatial data structure.

Method: A modeling framework using Gaussian processes for clustering observations across spatial locations. Instead of specifying covariance kernels based on spatial structure, the approach uses spatial information to inform a generalized Cholesky decomposition of precision matrices.

Result: The model successfully identifies gene clusters with distinctive spatial correlation patterns across different tissue areas, including tumoral and stromal regions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach prevents kernel misspecification issues and facilitates estimation of non-stationary spatial covariance structures, making it effective for analyzing spatial transcriptomic data.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics measures the expression of thousands of genes in a
tissue sample while preserving its spatial structure. This class of
technologies has enabled the investigation of the spatial variation of gene
expressions and their impact on specific biological processes. Identifying
genes with similar expression profiles is of utmost importance, thus motivating
the development of flexible methods leveraging spatial data structure to
cluster genes. Here, we propose a modeling framework for clustering
observations measured over numerous spatial locations via Gaussian processes.
Rather than specifying their covariance kernels as a function of the spatial
structure, we use it to inform a generalized Cholesky decomposition of their
precision matrices. This approach prevents issues with kernel misspecification
and facilitates the estimation of a non-stationarity spatial covariance
structure. Applied to spatial transcriptomic data, our model identifies gene
clusters with distinctive spatial correlation patterns across tissue areas
comprising different cell types, like tumoral and stromal areas.

*Subhrajyoty Roy,Abhik Ghosh,Ayanendranath Basu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A new robust rank estimation criterion called DICMR is proposed that combines computational simplicity with robustness to outliers, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rank estimation methods are either sensitive to outliers or computationally expensive when made robust, creating a need for a method that achieves both robustness and computational efficiency.

Method: The Divergence Information Criterion for Matrix Rank (DICMR) is derived from the density power divergence framework, providing robustness properties while maintaining computational simplicity.

Result: DICMR achieves accuracy comparable to robust cross-validation methods but with significantly lower computational cost, and demonstrates superior performance in real-world microarray imputation applications.

Conclusion: DICMR provides an effective solution for robust matrix rank estimation that balances computational efficiency with accuracy, making it suitable for practical applications where both robustness and speed are important.

Abstract: Estimating the true rank of a noisy data matrix is a fundamental problem
underlying techniques such as principal component analysis, matrix completion,
etc. Existing rank estimation criteria, including information-based and
cross-validation methods, are either highly sensitive to outliers or
computationally demanding when combined with robust estimators. This paper
proposes a new criterion, the Divergence Information Criterion for Matrix Rank
(DICMR), that achieves both robustness and computational simplicity. Derived
from the density power divergence framework, DICMR inherits the robustness
properties while being computationally very simple. We provide asymptotic
bounds on its overestimation and underestimation probabilities, and demonstrate
first-order B-robustness of the criteria. Extensive simulations show that DICMR
delivers accuracy comparable to the robustified cross-validation methods, but
with far lower computational cost. We also showcase a real-data application to
microarray imputation to further demonstrate its practical utility,
outperforming several state-of-the-art algorithms.

*George Stefan,Eleanor Pullenayegum*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper extends IIW-GEEs to handle informative dropout in longitudinal biomedical studies, showing that ignoring dropout bias leads to overestimated disease trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IIW-GEE methods are biased when health outcomes influence study dropout, which is common in longitudinal biomedical research with irregular visit patterns.

Method: Extended IIW-GEE framework to adjust for informative dropout, using visit intensity model estimates as weights in GEE with independent correlation structure.

Result: Simulation studies show significant bias reduction; application to STAR*D trial data reveals disease trajectories are overestimated when dropout is ignored.

Conclusion: The extended IIW-GEE method effectively reduces bias from informative dropout in longitudinal studies, improving accuracy of disease trajectory estimates.

Abstract: Longitudinal data are commonly encountered in biomedical research, including
randomized trials and retrospective cohort studies. Subjects are typically
followed over a period of time and may be scheduled for follow-up at
pre-determined time points. However, subjects may miss their appointments or
return at non-specified times, leading to irregularity in the visit process.
IIW-GEEs have been developed as one method to account for this irregularity,
whereby estimates from a visit intensity model are used as weights in a GEE
model with an independent correlation structure. We show that currently
available methods can be biased for situations in which the health outcome of
interest may influence a subject's dropout from the study. We have extended the
IIW-GEE framework to adjust for informative dropout and have demonstrated via
simulation studies that this bias can be significantly reduced. We have
illustrated this method using the STAR*D clinical trial data, and observed that
the disease trajectory was generally overestimated when informative dropout was
not accounted for.

TL;DR: This paper argues that statistics, not computer science, forms the fundamental theoretical and methodological core of artificial intelligence and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common narrative that AI is primarily a computer science revolution and demonstrate that statistical principles provide the indispensable foundation for modern AI systems.

Method: The authors deconstruct AI into nine foundational pillars (Inference, Density Estimation, Sequential Learning, Generalization, Representation Learning, Interpretability, Causality, Optimization, and Unification) and trace each pillar's roots to century-old statistical principles.

Result: The analysis demonstrates an unbroken statistical lineage across all major AI components, showing how statistical frameworks provide the theoretical foundation while computer science provides computational implementation.

Conclusion: Recognizing statistics as AI's backbone is crucial for developing robust, interpretable, and trustworthy intelligent systems. The paper calls for re-embracing statistical foundations in AI education, research, and practice.

Abstract: The rapid ascent of artificial intelligence (AI) is often portrayed as a
revolution born from computer science and engineering. This narrative, however,
obscures a fundamental truth: the theoretical and methodological core of AI is,
and has always been, statistical. This paper systematically argues that the
field of statistics provides the indispensable foundation for machine learning
and modern AI. We deconstruct AI into nine foundational pillars-Inference,
Density Estimation, Sequential Learning, Generalization, Representation
Learning, Interpretability, Causality, Optimization, and
Unification-demonstrating that each is built upon century-old statistical
principles. From the inferential frameworks of hypothesis testing and
estimation that underpin model evaluation, to the density estimation roots of
clustering and generative AI; from the time-series analysis inspiring recurrent
networks to the causal models that promise true understanding, we trace an
unbroken statistical lineage. While celebrating the computational engines that
power modern AI, we contend that statistics provides the brain-the theoretical
frameworks, uncertainty quantification, and inferential goals-while computer
science provides the brawn-the scalable algorithms and hardware. Recognizing
this statistical backbone is not merely an academic exercise, but a necessary
step for developing more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy intelligent
systems. We issue a call to action for education, research, and practice to
re-embrace this statistical foundation. Ignoring these roots risks building a
fragile future; embracing them is the path to truly intelligent machines. There
is no machine learning without statistical learning; no artificial intelligence
without statistical thought.

TL;DR: A novel federated learning framework for studying treatment effect heterogeneity across multiple data sources without sharing raw data, featuring doubly robust estimation and communication-efficient source selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing multi-source data improves causal estimation efficiency but faces challenges from population heterogeneity and privacy constraints. Existing federated methods focus on average causal effects and lack capability for studying effect modification.

Method: Targeted-federated learning framework with projection-based estimand for HTE analysis. Uses doubly robust estimation supporting both continuous and binary outcomes. Includes communication-efficient bootstrap-based procedure to detect non-transportable data sources.

Result: Superior performance over existing methods demonstrated through extensive simulations. Real-world application using Medicare-linked data shows practical utility. Framework enables robust information aggregation without introducing bias.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses HTE analysis in federated settings, handling population heterogeneity and privacy constraints while providing robust estimation and efficient source selection.

Abstract: Analyzing data from multiple sources offers valuable opportunities to improve
the estimation efficiency of causal estimands. However, this analysis also
poses many challenges due to population heterogeneity and data privacy
constraints. While several advanced methods for causal inference in federated
settings have been developed in recent years, many focus on difference-based
averaged causal effects and are not designed to study effect modification. In
this study, we introduce a novel targeted-federated learning framework to study
the heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTEs) for a targeted population by
proposing a projection-based estimand. This HTE framework integrates
information from multiple data sources without sharing raw data, while
accounting for covariate distribution shifts among sources. Our proposed
approach is shown to be doubly robust, conveniently supporting both
difference-based estimands for continuous outcomes and odds ratio-based
estimands for binary outcomes. Furthermore, we develop a
communication-efficient bootstrap-based selection procedure to detect
non-transportable data sources, thereby enhancing robust information
aggregation without introducing bias. The superior performance of the proposed
estimator over existing methods is demonstrated through extensive simulation
studies, and the utility of our approach has been shown in a real-world data
application using nationwide Medicare-linked data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes HOGL (hierarchical overlapping group Lasso) for simultaneous variable and polynomial degree selection in GMANOVA models using orthonormal polynomial basis functions to address high-degree polynomial fitting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two model selection problems in GMANOVA models: selecting explanatory variables and determining polynomial degrees, while handling issues with high-degree polynomial fitting.

Method: Uses hierarchical overlapping group Lasso with orthonormal basis functions transformed from polynomial basis, developing optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees.

Result: Performance evaluated through numerical simulations showing effective simultaneous variable and degree selection.

Conclusion: HOGL provides a unified approach for simultaneous variable and polynomial degree selection in GMANOVA models, effectively handling high-degree polynomial issues through orthonormal basis transformation.

Abstract: This paper deals with the GMANOVA model with a matrix of polynomial basis
functions as a within-individual design matrix. The model involves two model
selection problems: the selection of explanatory variables and the selection of
the degrees of the polynomials. The two problems can be uniformly addressed by
hierarchically incorporating zeros into the vectors of regression coefficients.
Based on this idea, we propose hierarchical overlapping group Lasso (HOGL) to
perform the variable and degree selections simultaneously. Importantly, when
using a polynomial basis, fitting a highdegree polynomial often causes problems
in model selection. In the approach proposed here, these problems are handled
by using a matrix of orthonormal basis functions obtained by transforming the
matrix of polynomial basis functions. Algorithms are developed with optimality
and convergence to optimize the method. The performance of the proposed method
is evaluated using numerical simulation.

### [99] [Living Synthetic Benchmarks: A Neutral and Cumulative Framework for Simulation Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19489)
*František Bartoš,Samuel Pawel,Björn S. Siepe*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes living synthetic benchmarks to address bias and fragmentation in simulation studies by separating method development from evaluation, enabling continuous updates of data-generating mechanisms, methods, and performance measures for neutral and systematic comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current simulation studies suffer from biased evaluations due to authors creating their own data-generating mechanisms to demonstrate superiority of their methods, leading to conflicting conclusions and hindering methodological progress.

Method: Introduces living synthetic benchmarks that decouple method development from simulation studies, allowing continuous updates of DGMs, competing methods, and performance measures through a systematic framework.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility with a prototype benchmark for publication bias adjustment methods, showing potential for neutral, reproducible, and cumulative method evaluation.

Conclusion: Living synthetic benchmarks can foster neutral, reproducible, and cumulative evaluation of statistical methods, benefiting both developers and users by enabling systematic comparisons and reducing bias.

Abstract: Simulation studies are widely used to evaluate statistical methods. However,
new methods are often introduced and evaluated using data-generating mechanisms
(DGMs) devised by the same authors. This coupling creates misaligned
incentives, e.g., the need to demonstrate the superiority of new methods,
potentially compromising the neutrality of simulation studies. Furthermore,
results of simulation studies are often difficult to compare due to differences
in DGMs, competing methods, and performance measures. This fragmentation can
lead to conflicting conclusions, hinder methodological progress, and delay the
adoption of effective methods. To address these challenges, we introduce the
concept of living synthetic benchmarks. The key idea is to disentangle method
and simulation study development and continuously update the benchmark whenever
a new DGM, method, or performance measure becomes available. This separation
benefits the neutrality of method evaluation, emphasizes the development of
both methods and DGMs, and enables systematic comparisons. In this paper, we
outline a blueprint for building and maintaining such benchmarks, discuss the
technical and organizational challenges of implementation, and demonstrate
feasibility with a prototype benchmark for publication bias adjustment methods.
We conclude that living synthetic benchmarks have the potential to foster
neutral, reproducible, and cumulative evaluation of methods, benefiting both
method developers and users.

### [100] [Calibrated Principal Component Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19020)
*Yixuan Florence Wu,Yilun Zhu,Lei Cao and,Naichen Shi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: CPCR is a calibrated principal component regression method that reduces truncation bias in overparameterized GLMs by learning a prior in PC subspace and calibrating via Tikhonov regularization, outperforming standard PCR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PCR incurs truncation bias when the true regression vector has components outside retained principal components, especially problematic in overparameterized regimes.

Method: CPCR first learns a low-variance prior in principal component subspace, then calibrates the model in original feature space using centered Tikhonov regularization with cross-fitting.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows CPCR outperforms PCR when regression signal has non-negligible components in low-variance directions. Empirical results demonstrate consistent prediction improvements across overparameterized problems.

Conclusion: CPCR provides stable and flexible inference in modern overparameterized settings by mitigating PCR's truncation bias through calibration and soft thresholding.

Abstract: We propose a new method for statistical inference in generalized linear
models. In the overparameterized regime, Principal Component Regression (PCR)
reduces variance by projecting high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional
principal subspace before fitting. However, PCR incurs truncation bias whenever
the true regression vector has mass outside the retained principal components
(PC). To mitigate the bias, we propose Calibrated Principal Component
Regression (CPCR), which first learns a low-variance prior in the PC subspace
and then calibrates the model in the original feature space via a centered
Tikhonov step. CPCR leverages cross-fitting and controls the truncation bias by
softening PCR's hard cutoff. Theoretically, we calculate the out-of-sample risk
in the random matrix regime, which shows that CPCR outperforms standard PCR
when the regression signal has non-negligible components in low-variance
directions. Empirically, CPCR consistently improves prediction across multiple
overparameterized problems. The results highlight CPCR's stability and
flexibility in modern overparameterized settings.

*Sebastian Reboul,Hélène Halconruy,Randal Douc*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A two-stage framework that uses offline data to learn value function bounds (envelopes) which are then incorporated into online RL algorithms, achieving better regret bounds and empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between offline data utilization and online reinforcement learning acceleration, addressing limited theoretical grounding in this direction.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) learn upper/lower value bounds from offline data, (2) incorporate these learned bounds into online algorithms. Uses decoupled bounds, data-driven envelopes modeled as random variables with filtration argument.

Result: Establishes high-probability regret bounds with interpretable quantities. Empirical results on tabular MDPs show substantial regret reductions compared to UCBVI and prior methods.

Conclusion: Provides a formal bridge between offline pre-training and online fine-tuning, demonstrating the effectiveness of learned value envelopes in accelerating online RL.

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental problem of leveraging offline data to
accelerate online reinforcement learning - a direction with strong potential
but limited theoretical grounding. Our study centers on how to learn and apply
value envelopes within this context. To this end, we introduce a principled
two-stage framework: the first stage uses offline data to derive upper and
lower bounds on value functions, while the second incorporates these learned
bounds into online algorithms. Our method extends prior work by decoupling the
upper and lower bounds, enabling more flexible and tighter approximations. In
contrast to approaches that rely on fixed shaping functions, our envelopes are
data-driven and explicitly modeled as random variables, with a filtration
argument ensuring independence across phases. The analysis establishes
high-probability regret bounds determined by two interpretable quantities,
thereby providing a formal bridge between offline pre-training and online
fine-tuning. Empirical results on tabular MDPs demonstrate substantial regret
reductions compared with both UCBVI and prior methods.

### [102] [Signature Kernel Scoring Rule as Spatio-Temporal Diagnostic for Probabilistic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19110)
*Archer Dodson,Ritabrata Dutta*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a signature kernel scoring rule for weather forecasting that captures temporal and spatial dependencies in weather data, outperforming traditional metrics like MSE and enabling effective probabilistic training of neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scoring rules like MSE fail to account for the highly correlated structures in weather data, limiting the effectiveness of data-driven forecasting models that produce probabilistic forecasts.

Method: The authors propose a signature kernel scoring rule based on rough path theory, reframing weather variables as continuous paths and encoding dependencies through iterated integrals. They validate it as strictly proper using path augmentations and apply it to train sliding window generative neural networks on ERA5 reanalysis data.

Result: Empirical evaluations on WeatherBench 2 models show the signature kernel scoring rule has high discriminative power and captures path-dependent interactions. Training with this method outperforms climatology for forecast paths up to fifteen timesteps using a lightweight model.

Conclusion: The signature kernel scoring rule provides a theoretically robust metric for weather forecast verification and model training, effectively capturing temporal and spatial dependencies that traditional metrics miss.

Abstract: Modern weather forecasting has increasingly transitioned from numerical
weather prediction (NWP) to data-driven machine learning forecasting
techniques. While these new models produce probabilistic forecasts to quantify
uncertainty, their training and evaluation may remain hindered by conventional
scoring rules, primarily MSE, which ignore the highly correlated data
structures present in weather and atmospheric systems. This work introduces the
signature kernel scoring rule, grounded in rough path theory, which reframes
weather variables as continuous paths to encode temporal and spatial
dependencies through iterated integrals. Validated as strictly proper through
the use of path augmentations to guarantee uniqueness, the signature kernel
provides a theoretically robust metric for forecast verification and model
training. Empirical evaluations through weather scorecards on WeatherBench 2
models demonstrate the signature kernel scoring rule's high discriminative
power and unique capacity to capture path-dependent interactions. Following
previous demonstration of successful adversarial-free probabilistic training,
we train sliding window generative neural networks using a
predictive-sequential scoring rule on ERA5 reanalysis weather data. Using a
lightweight model, we demonstrate that signature kernel based training
outperforms climatology for forecast paths of up to fifteen timesteps.

### [103] [Extreme Event Aware ($η$-) Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19161)
*Kai Chang,Themistoklis P. Sapsis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Introduces η-learning, a method that enables accurate prediction of extreme events even when training data lacks such events, using statistical regularization to enforce extreme event statistics during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven methods for predicting rare/extreme events require multiple extreme events in training data, leading to high uncertainty in extreme regions when such data is unavailable.

Method: η-learning uses statistical regularization to enforce extreme event statistics of an observable during training, without requiring actual extreme events in the data. This reduces uncertainty in extreme regions through optimal transport principles.

Result: The method successfully generates unprecedented extreme events even when training data lacks extremes, with theoretical justification and validation on prototype problems and real-world precipitation downscaling.

Conclusion: η-learning provides an effective framework for extreme event prediction that overcomes limitations of requiring extreme events in training data, enabling reliable predictions in uncharted extreme regions.

Abstract: Quantifying and predicting rare and extreme events persists as a crucial yet
challenging task in understanding complex dynamical systems. Many practical
challenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including
the considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial
computational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven
methods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a
typical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of
multiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the
sampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events
but with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or
$\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the
available data. $\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'
extreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an
observable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available
through qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of
statistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while
enforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the
generation of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack
extremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a
rigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method.
Additionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable
properties of the $\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and
real-world precipitation downscaling problems.

*Pattravadee de Favereau de Jeneret,Ioannis Diamantis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: TDA provides better clustering of currency behaviors than traditional statistical methods, yielding more compact and separated clusters with higher Calinski-Harabasz scores, though all methods show modest Silhouette scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if TDA can offer insights beyond traditional statistical methods in clustering currency behaviors, especially given the FX market's complex, non-linear, high-dimensional dynamics that classical techniques may not fully capture.

Method: Compare clustering results using TDA-derived features versus classical statistical features on monthly logarithmic returns of 13 major currency exchange rates against the euro, applying k-means and Hierarchical clustering algorithms and evaluating cluster quality via Silhouette score and Calinski-Harabasz index.

Result: TDA-based feature clustering produces more compact and well-separated clusters than clustering on traditional statistical features, achieving substantially higher Calinski-Harabasz scores. However, all clustering approaches yield modest Silhouette scores, indicating inherent difficulty in grouping FX time series. The differing cluster compositions suggest TDA captures structural patterns in currency co-movements that conventional methods might overlook.

Conclusion: TDA serves as a valuable complementary tool for analyzing financial time series, with potential applications in risk management where understanding structural co-movements is crucial.

Abstract: This study investigates whether Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can provide
additional insights beyond traditional statistical methods in clustering
currency behaviours. We focus on the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is a
complex system often exhibiting non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics that
classical techniques may not fully capture. We compare clustering results based
on TDA-derived features versus classical statistical features using monthly
logarithmic returns of 13 major currency exchange rates (all against the euro).
Two widely-used clustering algorithms, \(k\)-means and Hierarchical clustering,
are applied on both types of features, and cluster quality is evaluated via the
Silhouette score and the Calinski-Harabasz index. Our findings show that
TDA-based feature clustering produces more compact and well-separated clusters
than clustering on traditional statistical features, particularly achieving
substantially higher Calinski-Harabasz scores. However, all clustering
approaches yield modest Silhouette scores, underscoring the inherent difficulty
of grouping FX time series. The differing cluster compositions under TDA vs.
classical features suggest that TDA captures structural patterns in currency
co-movements that conventional methods might overlook. These results highlight
TDA as a valuable complementary tool for analysing financial time series, with
potential applications in risk management where understanding structural
co-movements is crucial.

Motivation: To automate legal document analysis and reduce the time and cost associated with contract review while maintaining high accuracy in legal clause identification.

Method: Uses LLM methodologies with robust text conversion, strategic chunk selection, Chain of Thought prompting, and structured tool calling on both CUAD and proprietary contract datasets.

Result: Substantial improvements in clause identification accuracy and efficiency, showing promise for reducing contract review time and costs.

Conclusion: Carefully optimized LLM systems could serve as valuable tools for legal professionals and increase access to efficient contract review services across organizations.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models has revolutionized tasks across domains,
including the automation of legal document analysis, a critical component of
modern contract management systems. This paper presents a comprehensive
implementation of LLM-enhanced metadata extraction for contract review,
focusing on the automatic detection and annotation of salient legal clauses.
Leveraging both the publicly available Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset
(CUAD) and proprietary contract datasets, our work demonstrates the integration
of advanced LLM methodologies with practical applications. We identify three
pivotal elements for optimizing metadata extraction: robust text conversion,
strategic chunk selection, and advanced LLM-specific techniques, including
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and structured tool calling. The results from
our experiments highlight the substantial improvements in clause identification
accuracy and efficiency. Our approach shows promise in reducing the time and
cost associated with contract review while maintaining high accuracy in legal
clause identification. The results suggest that carefully optimized LLM systems
could serve as valuable tools for legal professionals, potentially increasing
access to efficient contract review services for organizations of all sizes.

### [106] [On the hardness of RL with Lookahead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19372)
*Corentin Pla,Hugo Richard,Marc Abeille,Nadav Merlis,Vianney Perchet*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes reinforcement learning with transition look-ahead, showing that optimal planning with one-step look-ahead is computationally tractable (polynomial time), but becomes NP-hard for two or more steps of look-ahead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the computational complexity of using predictive transition information in reinforcement learning, as such look-ahead capabilities can significantly improve performance but may come with prohibitive computational costs.

Method: The authors use computational complexity analysis and provide a novel linear programming formulation for the one-step look-ahead case, while proving NP-hardness for multi-step look-ahead through theoretical analysis.

Result: The key result is that optimal planning with one-step look-ahead (ℓ=1) can be solved in polynomial time, but for ℓ≥2, the problem becomes NP-hard, establishing a clear computational boundary.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a precise boundary between tractable and intractable cases for planning with transition look-ahead in reinforcement learning, with one-step look-ahead being computationally feasible while multi-step look-ahead is computationally prohibitive.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) with transition look-ahead, where the
agent may observe which states would be visited upon playing any sequence of
$\ell$ actions before deciding its course of action. While such predictive
information can drastically improve the achievable performance, we show that
using this information optimally comes at a potentially prohibitive
computational cost. Specifically, we prove that optimal planning with one-step
look-ahead ($\ell=1$) can be solved in polynomial time through a novel linear
programming formulation. In contrast, for $\ell \geq 2$, the problem becomes
NP-hard. Our results delineate a precise boundary between tractable and
intractable cases for the problem of planning with transition look-ahead in
reinforcement learning.

### [107] [Square root Cox's survival analysis by the fittest linear and neural networks model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19374)
*Maxime van Cutsem,Sylvain Sardy*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for feature selection in survival analysis by tuning the LASSO penalty parameter directly for feature selection using the square root of Cox's partial likelihood, achieving better performance than traditional cross-validation or BIC approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature selection in survival analysis beyond traditional methods like cross-validation or BIC, which have limitations in reliably identifying relevant features.

Method: The approach directly tunes the LASSO penalty parameter λ for feature selection by taking the square root of Cox's partial likelihood, making it asymptotically pivotal. The method works with both linear models and artificial neural networks.

Result: The method substantially improves over both cross-validation LASSO and BIC subset selection, exhibiting a phase transition in the probability of retrieving all and only the relevant features, similar to compressed sensing.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides superior feature selection performance in survival analysis compared to traditional methods, with theoretical guarantees and applicability to both linear and neural network models.

Abstract: We revisit Cox's proportional hazard models and LASSO in the aim of improving
feature selection in survival analysis. Unlike traditional methods relying on
cross-validation or BIC, the penalty parameter $\lambda$ is directly tuned for
feature selection and is asymptotically pivotal thanks to taking the square
root of Cox's partial likelihood. Substantially improving over both
cross-validation LASSO and BIC subset selection, our approach has a phase
transition on the probability of retrieving all and only the good features,
like in compressed sensing. The method can be employed by linear models but
also by artificial neural networks.

### [108] [A Derandomization Framework for Structure Discovery: Applications in Neural Networks and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19382)
*Nikos Tsikouras,Yorgos Pantis,Ioannis Mitliagkas,Christos Tzamos*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies feature learning dynamics in neural networks, showing that under mild conditions, networks trained to second-order stationary points naturally discover low-rank structures in their weights, which reduces sample complexity for generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work by Mousavi-Hosseini et al. (2023) showed that two-layer student networks attain low-rank structures with strong regularization. This work aims to extend these findings to more realistic settings with weaker assumptions.

Method: The authors use a derandomization lemma showing that optimizing E_x[g_θ(Wx + b)] converges to W=0 under mild conditions. They study NNs of arbitrary size/depth with all parameters trainable, smooth loss functions, tiny regularization, and training methods that attain second-order stationary points.

Result: The paper demonstrates that neural networks trained to second-order stationary points naturally discover low-rank structures in their weights, even with minimal regularization. This structural property is shown to reduce sample complexity for generalization.

Conclusion: The derandomization lemma provides a fundamental explanation for structure discovery in neural networks and has broader applications in domains like MAXCUT approximation and Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of feature learning in neural networks (NNs)
remains a significant challenge. The work of (Mousavi-Hosseini et al., 2023)
analyzes a multiple index teacher-student setting and shows that a two-layer
student attains a low-rank structure in its first-layer weights when trained
with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and a strong regularizer. This
structural property is known to reduce sample complexity of generalization.
Indeed, in a second step, the same authors establish algorithm-specific
learning guarantees under additional assumptions. In this paper, we focus
exclusively on the structure discovery aspect and study it under weaker
assumptions, more specifically: we allow (a) NNs of arbitrary size and depth,
(b) with all parameters trainable, (c) under any smooth loss function, (d) tiny
regularization, and (e) trained by any method that attains a second-order
stationary point (SOSP), e.g.\ perturbed gradient descent (PGD). At the core of
our approach is a key $\textit{derandomization}$ lemma, which states that
optimizing the function $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}}
\left[g_{\theta}(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b})\right]$ converges to a
point where $\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{0}$, under mild conditions. The fundamental
nature of this lemma directly explains structure discovery and has immediate
applications in other domains including an end-to-end approximation for MAXCUT,
and computing Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings.
