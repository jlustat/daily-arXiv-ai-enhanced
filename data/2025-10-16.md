### [1] [Escaping Neal's Funnel: a multi-stage sampling method for hierarchical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12917)
*Aiden Gundersen,Neil J. Cornish*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical sampling method to address Neal's funnel problem in Bayesian hierarchical models by breaking sampling into stages, using a generalized model to reduce funnel sharpness and normalizing flows for efficient sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neal's funnel causes sampling difficulties in Bayesian hierarchical models, and existing solutions like reparameterization or analytical marginalization can be computationally expensive or impractical.

Method: Two-stage hierarchical sampling: first stage samples from a generalized hierarchical model to reduce funnel sharpness, second stage samples under constraints to recover original model's hyper-parameter marginals using normalizing flows.

Result: The method avoids Neal's funnel challenges without requiring computationally expensive reparameterizations, leveraging existing generalized models when available.

Conclusion: Hierarchical analysis performed hierarchically through staged sampling provides an effective alternative to traditional methods for handling Neal's funnel in Bayesian hierarchical models.

Abstract: Neal's funnel refers to an exponential tapering in probability densities
common to Bayesian hierarchical models. Usual sampling methods, such as Markov
Chain Monte Carlo, struggle to efficiently sample the funnel. Reparameterizing
the model or analytically marginalizing local parameters are common techniques
to remedy sampling pathologies in distributions exhibiting Neal's funnel. In
this paper, we show that the challenges of Neal's funnel can be avoided by
performing the hierarchical analysis, well, hierarchically. That is, instead of
sampling all parameters of the hierarchical model jointly, we break the
sampling into multiple stages. The first stage samples a generalized
(higher-dimensional) hierarchical model which is parameterized to lessen the
sharpness of the funnel. The next stage samples from the estimated density of
the first stage, but under a constraint which restricts the sampling to recover
the marginal distributions on the hyper-parameters of the original
(lower-dimensional) hierarchical model. A normalizing flow can be used to
represent the distribution from the first stage, such that it can easily be
sampled from for the second stage of the analysis. This technique is useful
when effective reparameterizations are computationally expensive to calculate,
or a generalized hierarchical model already exists from which it is easy to
sample.

### [2] [The $φ$-PCA Framework: A Unified and Efficiency-Preserving Approach with Robust Variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13159)
*Hung Hung,Zhi-Yu Jou,Su-Yun Huang,Shinto Eguchi*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces φ-PCA, a unified framework for robust and distributed PCA that addresses sensitivity to outliers and limitations in distributed environments while maintaining asymptotic efficiency of standard PCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PCA has limitations in handling outliers and distributed data environments, which restricts its effectiveness in modern large-scale applications.

Method: The φ-PCA framework aggregates multiple local estimates using proper φ functions to enhance ordering-robustness. Specifically, harmonic mean PCA (HM-PCA) with φ(u)=u⁻¹ achieves optimal ordering-robustness.

Result: φ-PCA methods retain asymptotic efficiency while providing more accurate eigensubspace estimation under contamination. Robustness increases with the number of partitions, and HM-PCA is recommended for practical use.

Conclusion: The partition-aggregation principle in φ-PCA offers a general strategy for developing robust and efficiency-preserving methodologies applicable to both robust and distributed data analysis.

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a fundamental tool in multivariate
statistics, yet its sensitivity to outliers and limitations in distributed
environments restrict its effectiveness in modern large-scale applications. To
address these challenges, we introduce the $\phi$-PCA framework which provides
a unified formulation of robust and distributed PCA. The class of $\phi$-PCA
methods retains the asymptotic efficiency of standard PCA, while aggregating
multiple local estimates using a proper $\phi$ function enhances
ordering-robustness, leading to more accurate eigensubspace estimation under
contamination. Notably, the harmonic mean PCA (HM-PCA), corresponding to the
choice $\phi(u)=u^{-1}$, achieves optimal ordering-robustness and is
recommended for practical use. Theoretical results further show that robustness
increases with the number of partitions, a phenomenon seldom explored in the
literature on robust or distributed PCA. Altogether, the partition-aggregation
principle underlying $\phi$-PCA offers a general strategy for developing robust
and efficiency-preserving methodologies applicable to both robust and
distributed data analysis.

### [3] [Learning Shared and Source-specific Subspaces across Multiple Data Sources for Functional Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13010)
*Chi Zhang,Peijun Sang,Yingli Qin*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A projection-based method for integrating multi-source functional data that separates shared and source-specific subspaces, addressing bias from direct averaging of covariance operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct averaging of sample covariance operators across heterogeneous data sources assumes homogeneity and biases recovery of both shared and source-specific variation patterns.

Method: Estimates source-specific projection operators via smoothing, isolates shared subspace through eigenvalues of averaged projection operators, and extracts source-specific subspaces by re-projecting onto orthogonal complements.

Result: Establishes asymptotic properties of subspace estimators and demonstrates effectiveness through extensive simulations across various settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively separates shared and source-specific subspaces in multi-source functional data integration, with practical utility shown in air pollutant data analysis.

Abstract: In the era of big data, integrating multi-source functional data to extract a
subspace that captures the shared subspace across sources has attracted
considerable attention. In practice, data collection procedures often follow
source-specific protocols. Directly averaging sample covariance operators
across sources implicitly assumes homogeneity, which may bias the recovery of
both shared and source-specific variation patterns. To address this issue, we
propose a projection-based data integration method that explicitly separates
the shared and source-specific subspaces. The method first estimates
source-specific projection operators via smoothing to accommodate the
nonparametric nature of functional data. The shared subspace is then isolated
by examining the eigenvalues of the averaged projection operator across all
sources. If a source-specific subspace is of interest, we re-project the
associated source-specific covariance estimator onto the subspace orthogonal to
the estimated shared subspace, and estimate the source-specific subspace from
the resulting projection. We further establish the asymptotic properties of
both the shared and source-specific subspace estimators. Extensive simulation
studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across a wide
range of settings. Finally, we illustrate its practical utility with an example
of air pollutant data.

### [4] [Non-asymptotic goodness-of-fit tests and model selection in valued stochastic blockmodels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13636)
*Félix Almendra-Hernández,Miles Bakenhus,Vishesh Karwa,Mitsunori Ogawa,Sonja Petrović*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper develops goodness-of-fit tests for valued stochastic blockmodels (SBMs), including Poisson and labeled SBMs, with finite-sample tests using Markov bases and asymptotic analysis for determining block influence on network formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for testing goodness-of-fit in non-Bernoulli stochastic blockmodels, which include various dyad sampling schemes like Poisson, labeled, and censored-edge models, and to determine whether block membership influences network formation.

Method: Derived explicit Markov basis moves to generate samples from reference distributions, defined goodness-of-fit statistics comparable to literature, studied asymptotic behavior for labeled SBMs, and verified power and Type 1 error rates on simulated data.

Result: Developed finite-sample tests for valued SBMs, showed asymptotic behavior of statistics for labeled SBMs, and applied the Poisson SBM method to ecological host-parasite networks, obtaining different conclusions about block selection compared to previous literature.

Conclusion: The paper provides comprehensive goodness-of-fit testing framework for valued SBMs, enabling determination of block influence on network formation and offering improved model selection for ecological network analysis.

Abstract: A valued stochastic blockmodel (SBM) is a general way to view networked data
in which nodes are grouped into blocks and links between them are measured by
counts or labels. This family allows for varying dyad sampling schemes, thereby
including the classical, Poisson, and labeled SBMs, as well as those in which
some edge observations are censored. This paper addresses the question of
testing goodness-of-fit of such non-Bernoulli SBMs, focusing in particular on
finite-sample tests. We derive explicit Markov bases moves necessary to
generate samples from reference distributions and define goodness-of-fit
statistics for determining model fit, comparable to those in the literature for
related model families.
  For the labeled SBM, which includes in particular the censored-edge model, we
study the asymptotic behavior of said statistics. One of the main purposes of
testing goodness-of-fit of an SBM is to determine whether block membership of
the nodes influences network formation. Power and Type 1 error rates are
verified on simulated data. Additionally, we discuss the use of asymptotic
results in selecting the number of blocks under the latent-block modeling
assumption. The method derived for Poisson SBM is applied to ecological
networks of host-parasite interactions. Our data analysis conclusions differ in
selecting the number of blocks for the species from previous results in the
literature.

### [5] [Edgington's Method for Random-Effects Meta-Analysis Part II: Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13216)
*David Kronthaler,Leonhard Held*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper addresses statistical inference limitations in random-effects meta-analysis by developing predictive distributions that account for uncertainty in heterogeneity estimation, showing improved coverage compared to methods ignoring this uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Statistical inference about average effects in random-effects meta-analysis is insufficient when substantial between-study heterogeneity exists. Predictive distributions are needed to quantify heterogeneity on the effect scale and provide clinically relevant information about future events.

Method: The authors construct predictive distributions using confidence distributions derived from Edgington's p-value combination method and the generalized heterogeneity statistic, accounting for uncertainty in heterogeneity estimation.

Result: Simulation results show that 95% prediction intervals achieve nominal coverage when more than three studies are available and effectively reflect skewness in effect estimates with 20 or fewer studies. Methods ignoring uncertainty in heterogeneity estimation typically fail to achieve correct coverage.

Conclusion: The proposed adjustment for uncertainty in heterogeneity estimation is necessary in random-effects meta-analysis, as formulations ignoring this uncertainty generally fail to provide correct coverage, highlighting the importance of this methodological improvement.

Abstract: Statistical inference about the average effect in random-effects
meta-analysis has been considered insufficient in the presence of substantial
between-study heterogeneity. Predictive distributions are well-suited for
quantifying heterogeneity since they are interpretable on the effect scale and
provide clinically relevant information about future events. We construct
predictive distributions accounting for uncertainty through confidence
distributions from Edgington's $p$-value combination method and the generalized
heterogeneity statistic. Simulation results suggest that 95% prediction
intervals typically achieve nominal coverage when more than three studies are
available and effectively reflect skewness in effect estimates in scenarios
with 20 or less studies. Formulations that ignore uncertainty in heterogeneity
estimation typically fail to achieve correct coverage, underscoring the need
for this adjustment in random-effects meta-analysis.

### [6] [Scalable Bayesian inference for high-dimensional mixed-type multivariate spatial data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13233)
*Arghya Mukherjee,Arnab Hazra,Dootika Vats*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A Bayesian spatial method using latent multivariate Gaussian processes for joint modeling of mixed-type multivariate spatial responses, with computational efficiency achieved through Vecchia approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern technology produces vector-valued mixed-type responses (binary, count, continuous) at spatial locations, but existing methods for joint modeling of such responses are rare.

Method: Uses latent multivariate Gaussian processes with Vecchia approximation for computational efficiency, employing MCMC-based inference with elliptical slice sampling in a blocked Metropolis-within-Gibbs framework.

Result: The method effectively models mixed-type spatial responses, with theoretical properties established including identifiability and covariance structure. Demonstrated through simulations and wildfire data application.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an effective framework for joint modeling of mixed-type multivariate spatial responses with computational efficiency, validated through theoretical analysis and empirical applications.

Abstract: Spatial generalized linear mixed-effects methods are popularly used to model
spatially indexed univariate responses. However, with modern technology, it is
common to observe vector-valued mixed-type responses, e.g., a combination of
binary, count, or continuous types, at each location. Methods that allow joint
modeling of such mixed-type multivariate spatial responses are rare. Using
latent multivariate Gaussian processes (GPs), we present a class of Bayesian
spatial methods that can be employed for any combination of exponential family
responses. Since multivariate GP-based methods can suffer from computational
bottlenecks when the number of spatial locations is high, we further employ a
computationally efficient Vecchia approximation for fast posterior inference
and prediction. Key theoretical properties of the proposed model, such as
identifiability and the structure of the induced covariance, are established.
Our approach employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based inference method that
utilizes elliptical slice sampling in a blocked Metropolis-within-Gibbs
sampling framework. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method through
simulation studies and a real-data application on joint modeling of wildfire
counts and burnt areas across the United States.

### [7] [postcard: An R Package for Marginal Effect Estimation with or without Prognostic Score Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13347)
*Mathias Lerbech Jeppesen,Emilie Højbjerre-Frandsen*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces an R package called 'postcard' that implements GLM plug-in methods for covariate adjustment in randomized clinical trials, with optional prognostic score adjustment to improve efficiency and power estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a practical toolkit for statisticians to implement efficient covariate adjustment methods in RCTs, building on existing work by Rosenblum and van der Laan (2010) and extending Schuler et al.'s (2022) prognostic score approach to GLM frameworks.

Method: The package implements GLM plug-in procedures with optional prognostic covariate adjustment, using Discrete Super Learner for prognostic score construction, and provides power approximation formulas that remain valid under model misspecification.

Result: The postcard package enables efficient marginal effect estimation with reduced variance, semi-parametric efficiency under additive treatment effect assumptions, and realistic sample size planning through robust power approximation.

Conclusion: Postcard serves as a comprehensive practical toolkit for statisticians to apply advanced covariate adjustment methods in clinical trials, offering both estimation and power calculation capabilities with simulation support for method validation.

Abstract: Covariate adjustment is a widely used technique in randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) for improving the efficiency of treatment effect estimators. By
adjusting for predictive baseline covariates, variance can be reduced,
enhancing statistical precision and study power. Rosenblum and van der Laan
[2010] use the framework of generalized linear models (GLMs) in a plug-in
analysis to show efficiency gains using covariate adjustment for marginal
effect estimation. Recently the use of prognostic scores as adjustment
covariates has gained popularity. Schuler et al. [2022] introduce and validate
the method for continuous endpoints using linear models. Building on this work
H{\o}jbjerre-Frandsen et al. [2025] extends the method proposed by Schuler et
al. [2022] to be used in combination with the GLM plug-in procedure [Rosenblum
and van der Laan, 2010]. This method achieves semi-parametric efficiency under
assumptions of additive treatment effects on the link scale. Additionally,
H{\o}jbjerre-Frandsen et al. [2025] provide a formula for power approximation
which is valid even under model misspecification, enabling realistic sample
size estimation. This article introduces an R package, which implements the GLM
plug-in method with or without PrOgnoSTic CovARiate aDjustment, postcard. The
package has two core features: (1) estimating marginal effects and the variance
hereof (with or without prognostic adjustment) and (2) approximating
statistical power. Functionalities also include integration of the Discrete
Super Learner for constructing prognostic scores and simulation capabilities
for exploring the methods in practice. Through examples and simulations, we
demonstrate postcard as a practical toolkit for statisticians.

### [8] [A Flexible Partially Linear Single Index Proportional Hazards Regression Model for Multivariate Survival Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13377)
*Na Lei,Mark A. Wolters,Wenqing He*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A survival regression model for multivariate responses with nonlinear covariate effects using weakly-parametric elements including piecewise constant baseline hazards, copula-based association modeling, and spline-based single-index structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional survival models in handling multivariate responses and nonlinear covariate effects, extending the proportional hazards model with flexible weakly-parametric components.

Method: Extends proportional hazards model with piecewise constant baseline hazards, copula-based association modeling for correlated responses, and spline-based single-index structure for nonlinear covariate effects. Uses full likelihood approach for inference.

Result: Simulation studies and application to Busselton health study data show the method effectively captures nonlinear covariate effects and benefits from modeling association between correlated responses.

Conclusion: The proposed weakly-parametric survival model successfully handles multivariate responses with nonlinear covariate effects, providing individual-level survival estimates and demonstrating improved performance through association modeling.

Abstract: We address the problem of survival regression modelling with multivariate
responses and nonlinear covariate effects. Our model extends the proportional
hazards model by introducing several weakly-parametric elements: the marginal
baseline hazard functions are expressed as piecewise constants, association is
modelled with copulas, and nonlinear covariate effects are handled by a
single-index structure using a spline. The model permits a full likelihood
approach to inference, making it possible to obtain individual-level survival
or hazard function estimates. Performance of the new model is evaluated through
simulation studies and application to the Busselton health study data. The
results suggest that the proposed method can capture nonlinear covariate
effects well, and that there is benefit to modeling the association between the
correlated responses.

### [9] [Understanding and Using the Relative Importance Measures Based on Orthonormality Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13389)
*Tien-En Chang,Argon Chen*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper analyzes relative importance measures based on orthonormality transformation (OTMs), particularly Johnson's Relative Weight, by breaking them into orthogonalization and reallocation steps. Through Monte Carlo simulations, it shows Johnson's minimal transformation outperforms other methods and provides guidelines for selecting reallocation methods based on predictor correlation structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The theoretical foundation of OTMs remains unclear despite Johnson's Relative Weight being considered the most successful OTM. The research aims to better understand OTMs by decomposing them into functional components and assessing their performance.

Method: Developed a generalized framework breaking OTMs into orthogonalization and reallocation steps. Conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations under various predictors' correlation structures and response variable distributions to assess each step's impact.

Result: Johnson's minimal transformation consistently outperforms other orthogonalization methods. Performance of reallocation methods varies across four scenarios of predictors' correlation structures based on first principal component and VIF analysis.

Conclusion: The research provides deeper understanding of OTMs and practical guidelines for selecting appropriate reallocation methods in different scenarios, helping practitioners accurately measure variable importance in various modeling contexts.

Abstract: A class of relative importance measures based on orthonormality
transformation (OTMs), has been found to effectively approximate the General
Dominance index (GD). In particular, Johnson's Relative Weight (RW) has been
deemed the most successful OTM in the literature. Nevertheless, the theoretical
foundation of the OTMs remains unclear. To further understand the OTMs, we
provide a generalized framework that breaks down the OTM into two functional
steps: orthogonalization and reallocation. To assess the impact of each step on
the performance of OTMs, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulations under
various predictors' correlation structures and response variable distributions.
Our findings reveal that Johnson's minimal transformation consistently
outperforms other common orthogonalization methods. We also summarize the
performance of reallocation methods under four scenarios of predictors'
correlation structures in terms of the first principal component and the
variance inflation factor (VIF). This analysis provides guidelines for
selecting appropriate reallocation methods in different scenarios, illustrated
with real-world dataset examples. Our research offers a deeper understanding of
OTMs and provides valuable insights for practitioners seeking to accurately
measure variable importance in various modeling contexts.

### [10] [Exact Coordinate Descent for High-Dimensional Regularized Huber Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13715)
*Younghoon Kim,Po-Ling Loh,Sumanta Basu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: An exact coordinate descent algorithm for high-dimensional regularized Huber regression that outperforms existing methods, especially with sparse models and heavy-tailed correlated predictors, using novel variable screening rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like composite gradient descent don't fully exploit sparsity advantages, and second-order approximation methods fail when Hessians become ill-conditioned due to heavy-tailed correlated covariates.

Method: Coordinate descent algorithm where marginal increments come only from inlier observations, with derivatives monotonically increasing over partial residual grids. Includes variable screening rules to selectively update variables per iteration.

Result: First first-order coordinate descent algorithm for penalized Huber loss minimization. Bounded nonasymptotic convergence rate and characterized screening rule operation. Extensive simulations show practical efficiency with heavy-tailed, highly-correlated predictors.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively handles sparse models and ill-conditioned scenarios, demonstrating superior performance through theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: We develop an exact coordinate descent algorithm for high-dimensional
regularized Huber regression. In contrast to composite gradient descent
methods, our algorithm fully exploits the advantages of coordinate descent when
the underlying model is sparse. Moreover, unlike existing second-order
approximation methods previously introduced in the literature, it remains
effective even when the Hessian becomes ill-conditioned due to high
correlations among covariates drawn from heavy-tailed distributions. The key
idea is that, for each coordinate, marginal increments arise only from inlier
observations, while the derivatives remain monotonically increasing over a grid
constructed from the partial residuals. Building on conventional coordinate
descent strategies, we further propose variable screening rules that
selectively determine which variables to update at each iteration, thereby
accelerating convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
to develop a first-order coordinate descent algorithm for penalized Huber loss
minimization. We bound the nonasymptotic convergence rate of the proposed
algorithm by extending arguments developed for the Lasso and formally
characterize the operation of the proposed screening rule. Extensive simulation
studies under heavy-tailed and highly-correlated predictors, together with a
real data application, demonstrate both the practical efficiency of the method
and the benefits of the computational enhancements.

### [11] [Efficient Inference for Coupled Hidden Markov Models in Continuous Time and Discrete Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12916)
*Giosue Migliorini,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Interacting Particle Systems, a method for tractable inference in high-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain systems using look-ahead functions and twisted Sequential Monte Carlo sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference in high-dimensional systems of interacting continuous-time Markov chains is typically intractable, especially when incorporating discrete-time noisy observations via Doob's h-transform, which creates an intractable posterior process requiring approximation.

Method: The authors parameterize the generator of each Markov chain and estimate look-ahead functions (twist potentials) that anticipate future information, using an efficient parameterization. This approximation is incorporated in a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo sampling scheme.

Result: The approach is demonstrated to be effective on a challenging posterior inference task for a latent SIRS model on a graph and on a neural model for wildfire spread dynamics trained on real data.

Conclusion: Latent Interacting Particle Systems provide a practical solution for inference in high-dimensional interacting Markov chain systems by combining parameterized generators with efficient twist potential estimation and Sequential Monte Carlo sampling.

Abstract: Systems of interacting continuous-time Markov chains are a powerful model
class, but inference is typically intractable in high dimensional settings.
Auxiliary information, such as noisy observations, is typically only available
at discrete times, and incorporating it via a Doob's $h-$transform gives rise
to an intractable posterior process that requires approximation. We introduce
Latent Interacting Particle Systems, a model class parameterizing the generator
of each Markov chain in the system. Our inference method involves estimating
look-ahead functions (twist potentials) that anticipate future information, for
which we introduce an efficient parameterization. We incorporate this
approximation in a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a challenging posterior
inference task for a latent SIRS model on a graph, and on a neural model for
wildfire spread dynamics trained on real data.

*Lorenzo Marinucci,Gabriele D'Acunto,Paolo Di Lorenzo,Sergio Barbarossa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Simplicial Gaussian Model (SGM) that extends Gaussian probabilistic graphical models to simplicial complexes, enabling modeling of higher-order interactions beyond pairwise dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic graphical models are limited to pairwise interactions, but many real-world systems involve higher-order dependencies. The authors aim to extend these models to capture interactions at multiple topological levels (vertices, edges, triangles) within simplicial complexes.

Method: The SGM builds on discrete Hodge theory and models random variables on vertices, edges, and triangles using a single parametrized Gaussian distribution. The method treats node- and triangle-level variables as latent while focusing on edge-level marginals, and develops a maximum-likelihood inference algorithm to recover model parameters and conditional dependence structure.

Result: Numerical experiments on synthetic simplicial complexes of varying size and sparsity demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively recovers the parameters and dependence structure of the full SGM.

Conclusion: The Simplicial Gaussian Model successfully extends Gaussian probabilistic graphical models to handle higher-order interactions in simplicial complexes, providing a framework for modeling complex dependencies across multiple topological levels with demonstrated effectiveness through numerical validation.

Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are powerful tools for representing
statistical dependencies through graphs in high-dimensional systems. However,
they are limited to pairwise interactions. In this work, we propose the
simplicial Gaussian model (SGM), which extends Gaussian PGM to simplicial
complexes. SGM jointly models random variables supported on vertices, edges,
and triangles, within a single parametrized Gaussian distribution. Our model
builds upon discrete Hodge theory and incorporates uncertainty at every
topological level through independent random components. Motivated by
applications, we focus on the marginal edge-level distribution while treating
node- and triangle-level variables as latent. We then develop a
maximum-likelihood inference algorithm to recover the parameters of the full
SGM and the induced conditional dependence structure. Numerical experiments on
synthetic simplicial complexes with varying size and sparsity confirm the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

*Tianmin Xie,Yanfei Zhou,Ziyi Liang,Stefano Favaro,Matteo Sesia*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A conformal prediction method for classification in imbalanced and open-set settings that handles unseen classes and improves prediction efficiency through selective sample splitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in open-set scenarios with unseen classes and become overly conservative with imbalanced data, requiring new approaches that maintain coverage guarantees while handling infinite possible labels.

Method: Develops new conformal p-values to test for unseen classes, establishes theoretical optimality, and creates selective sample splitting algorithm that partitions data by label frequency while maintaining finite-sample guarantees through re-weighting.

Result: The method achieves valid coverage in open-set scenarios with infinite possible labels and produces more informative predictions under extreme class imbalance, as demonstrated with both simulated and real data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses limitations of existing conformal prediction methods by handling unseen classes and improving efficiency in imbalanced settings while maintaining statistical guarantees.

Abstract: This paper presents a conformal prediction method for classification in
highly imbalanced and open-set settings, where there are many possible classes
and not all may be represented in the data. Existing approaches require a
finite, known label space and typically involve random sample splitting, which
works well when there is a sufficient number of observations from each class.
Consequently, they have two limitations: (i) they fail to provide adequate
coverage when encountering new labels at test time, and (ii) they may become
overly conservative when predicting previously seen labels. To obtain valid
prediction sets in the presence of unseen labels, we compute and integrate into
our predictions a new family of conformal p-values that can test whether a new
data point belongs to a previously unseen class. We study these p-values
theoretically, establishing their optimality, and uncover an intriguing
connection with the classical Good--Turing estimator for the probability of
observing a new species. To make more efficient use of imbalanced data, we also
develop a selective sample splitting algorithm that partitions training and
calibration data based on label frequency, leading to more informative
predictions. Despite breaking exchangeability, this allows maintaining
finite-sample guarantees through suitable re-weighting. With both simulated and
real data, we demonstrate our method leads to prediction sets with valid
coverage even in challenging open-set scenarios with infinite numbers of
possible labels, and produces more informative predictions under extreme class
imbalance.

### [14] [A Multi-dimensional Semantic Surprise Framework Based on Low-Entropy Semantic Manifolds for Fine-Grained Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13093)
*Ningkang Peng,Yuzhe Mao,Yuhao Zhang,Linjin Qian,Qianfeng Yu,Yanhui Gu,Yi Chen,Li Kong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection that shifts from binary classification to a ternary classification (ID vs. Near-OOD vs. Far-OOD) using Semantic Surprise Vector and Low-Entropy Semantic Manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods treat it as binary classification, failing to distinguish between semantically close (Near-OOD) and distant (Far-OOD) unknown risks, creating safety bottlenecks in applications requiring fine-grained risk stratification.

Method: Proposes an information-theoretic framework using Low-Entropy Semantic Manifolds structured to reflect data's intrinsic semantic hierarchy. Uses Hierarchical Prototypical Network to construct manifolds and introduces Semantic Surprise Vector (SSV) that decomposes surprise into conformity, novelty, and ambiguity dimensions.

Result: The framework establishes new state-of-the-art on ternary classification task and achieves top results on conventional binary benchmarks, reducing False Positive Rate by over 60% on datasets like LSUN.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm shift from probabilistic to information-theoretic framework enables fine-grained OOD risk stratification through semantic surprise quantification, providing both superior performance and interpretable risk assessment.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a cornerstone for the safe deployment
of AI systems in the open world. However, existing methods treat OOD detection
as a binary classification problem, a cognitive flattening that fails to
distinguish between semantically close (Near-OOD) and distant (Far-OOD) unknown
risks. This limitation poses a significant safety bottleneck in applications
requiring fine-grained risk stratification. To address this, we propose a
paradigm shift from a conventional probabilistic view to a principled
information-theoretic framework. We formalize the core task as quantifying the
Semantic Surprise of a new sample and introduce a novel ternary classification
challenge: In-Distribution (ID) vs. Near-OOD vs. Far-OOD. The theoretical
foundation of our work is the concept of Low-Entropy Semantic Manifolds, which
are explicitly structured to reflect the data's intrinsic semantic hierarchy.
To construct these manifolds, we design a Hierarchical Prototypical Network. We
then introduce the Semantic Surprise Vector (SSV), a universal probe that
decomposes a sample's total surprise into three complementary and interpretable
dimensions: conformity, novelty, and ambiguity. To evaluate performance on this
new task, we propose the Normalized Semantic Risk (nSR), a cost-sensitive
metric. Experiments demonstrate that our framework not only establishes a new
state-of-the-art (sota) on the challenging ternary task, but its robust
representations also achieve top results on conventional binary benchmarks,
reducing the False Positive Rate by over 60% on datasets like LSUN.

Motivation: Machine unlearning faces theoretical challenges in high dimensions where standard optimization assumptions rarely hold, and prior work required multiple Newton steps for effective unlearning.

Method: Introduces ε-Gaussian certifiability and analyzes a one-step Newton method with calibrated Gaussian noise for machine unlearning in high-dimensional proportional regimes.

Result: A single Newton step followed by calibrated Gaussian noise is sufficient to achieve both privacy and accuracy in high-dimensional machine unlearning.

Conclusion: ε-Gaussian certifiability optimally overcomes limitations of prior ε-certifiability approaches, enabling efficient single-step unlearning with noise mechanisms in high dimensions.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to efficiently remove the influence of selected data
while preserving generalization. Significant progress has been made in low
dimensions $(p \ll n)$, but high dimensions pose serious theoretical challenges
as standard optimization assumptions of $\Omega(1)$ strong convexity and $O(1)$
smoothness of the per-example loss $f$ rarely hold simultaneously in
proportional regimes $(p\sim n)$. In this work, we introduce
$\varepsilon$-Gaussian certifiability, a canonical and robust notion
well-suited to high-dimensional regimes, that optimally captures a broad class
of noise adding mechanisms. Then we theoretically analyze the performance of a
widely used unlearning algorithm based on one step of the Newton method in the
high-dimensional setting described above. Our analysis shows that a single
Newton step, followed by a well-calibrated Gaussian noise, is sufficient to
achieve both privacy and accuracy in this setting. This result stands in sharp
contrast to the only prior work that analyzes machine unlearning in high
dimensions \citet{zou2025certified}, which relaxes some of the standard
optimization assumptions for high-dimensional applicability, but operates under
the notion of $\varepsilon$-certifiability. That work concludes %that a single
Newton step is insufficient even for removing a single data point, and that at
least two steps are required to ensure both privacy and accuracy. Our result
leads us to conclude that the discrepancy in the number of steps arises because
of the sub optimality of the notion of $\varepsilon$-certifiability and its
incompatibility with noise adding mechanisms, which $\varepsilon$-Gaussian
certifiability is able to overcome optimally.

*Pierre Glaser,Kevin Han Huang,Arthur Gretton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper provides a non-asymptotic analysis of the contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm, showing it can achieve parametric O(n^{-1/2}) convergence rate under regularity assumptions, improving upon prior O(n^{-1/3}) results, and demonstrates near-optimal asymptotic variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish better convergence guarantees for the contrastive divergence algorithm, which is widely used for training unnormalized models but previously had suboptimal asymptotic convergence rates.

Method: Non-asymptotic analysis of CD algorithm under regularity assumptions, examining various data batching schemes including fully online and minibatch approaches.

Result: CD can achieve parametric O(n^{-1/2}) convergence rate to the true parameter, and its asymptotic variance is close to the Cramér-Rao lower bound, making it near-optimal.

Conclusion: The contrastive divergence algorithm can achieve optimal parametric convergence rates and near-optimal asymptotic variance under appropriate conditions, providing stronger theoretical guarantees than previously established.

Abstract: We perform a non-asymptotic analysis of the contrastive divergence (CD)
algorithm, a training method for unnormalized models. While prior work has
established that (for exponential family distributions) the CD iterates
asymptotically converge at an $O(n^{-1 / 3})$ rate to the true parameter of the
data distribution, we show, under some regularity assumptions, that CD can
achieve the parametric rate $O(n^{-1 / 2})$. Our analysis provides results for
various data batching schemes, including the fully online and minibatch ones.
We additionally show that CD can be near-optimal, in the sense that its
asymptotic variance is close to the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound.

### [17] [Robust Minimax Boosting with Performance Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13445)
*Santiago Mazuelas,Veronica Alvarez*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: RMBoost is a robust minimax boosting method that provides strong classification accuracy while being resilient to various types of label noise, with finite-sample performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Boosting methods perform well in classification but degrade significantly with label noise. Existing robust methods have limited theoretical guarantees for realistic noise types and finite training sizes, and can have unsatisfactory accuracy even without noise.

Method: Developed robust minimax boosting (RMBoost) methods that minimize worst-case error probabilities and are robust to general types of label noise.

Result: RMBoost provides finite-sample performance guarantees relative to noise-free error and Bayes risk. Experimental results show it maintains strong classification accuracy while being resilient to label noise.

Conclusion: RMBoost effectively addresses the limitations of existing boosting methods by providing robustness to label noise while maintaining high classification accuracy, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Boosting methods often achieve excellent classification accuracy, but can
experience notable performance degradation in the presence of label noise.
Existing robust methods for boosting provide theoretical robustness guarantees
for certain types of label noise, and can exhibit only moderate performance
degradation. However, previous theoretical results do not account for realistic
types of noise and finite training sizes, and existing robust methods can
provide unsatisfactory accuracies, even without noise. This paper presents
methods for robust minimax boosting (RMBoost) that minimize worst-case error
probabilities and are robust to general types of label noise. In addition, we
provide finite-sample performance guarantees for RMBoost with respect to the
error obtained without noise and with respect to the best possible error (Bayes
risk). The experimental results corroborate that RMBoost is not only resilient
to label noise but can also provide strong classification accuracy.

### [18] [On the identifiability of causal graphs with multiple environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13583)
*Francesco Montagna*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Causal discovery becomes identifiable with access to the structural causal model distribution and data from just two sufficiently different environments, even with arbitrary nonlinear mechanisms. This is the first result guaranteeing full causal graph recovery with constant environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery from i.i.d. observational data is generally ill-posed. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by leveraging additional data from multiple environments.

Method: Uses distribution of structural causal model and data from only two environments that sufficiently differ in noise statistics. The approach builds on duality between independent component analysis (ICA) and causal discovery, requiring Gaussian noise terms.

Result: Demonstrates that the unique causal graph is identifiable with just two environments, which is the first result guaranteeing entire causal graph recovery with constant number of environments and arbitrary nonlinear mechanisms.

Conclusion: The paper shows causal discovery can be achieved with much less auxiliary information than previously thought, expanding the known duality between ICA and causal discovery while proposing ways to relax the Gaussian noise constraint.

Abstract: Causal discovery from i.i.d. observational data is known to be generally
ill-posed. We demonstrate that if we have access to the distribution of a
structural causal model, and additional data from only two environments that
sufficiently differ in the noise statistics, the unique causal graph is
identifiable. Notably, this is the first result in the literature that
guarantees the entire causal graph recovery with a constant number of
environments and arbitrary nonlinear mechanisms. Our only constraint is the
Gaussianity of the noise terms; however, we propose potential ways to relax
this requirement. Of interest on its own, we expand on the well-known duality
between independent component analysis (ICA) and causal discovery; recent
advancements have shown that nonlinear ICA can be solved from multiple
environments, at least as many as the number of sources: we show that the same
can be achieved for causal discovery while having access to much less auxiliary
information.

*Yang Yang,Severi Rissanen,Paul E. Chang,Nasrulloh Loka,Daolang Huang,Arno Solin,Markus Heinonen,Luigi Acerbi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: PriorGuide enables diffusion-based amortized inference models to adapt to new prior distributions at test time without retraining, overcoming the limitation of fixed training priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Amortized simulator-based inference methods are constrained by the prior distributions used during training, limiting their flexibility when new information or expert knowledge becomes available post-training.

Method: PriorGuide introduces a novel guidance approximation technique for diffusion-based amortized inference methods that allows flexible adaptation to new priors at test time.

Result: The method enables trained diffusion models to incorporate updated prior information without requiring costly retraining, maintaining computational efficiency while enhancing model versatility.

Conclusion: PriorGuide significantly enhances the practical applicability of amortized inference methods by allowing flexible prior adaptation, making pre-trained models more versatile for real-world applications where prior information may evolve.

Abstract: Amortized simulator-based inference offers a powerful framework for tackling
Bayesian inference in computational fields such as engineering or neuroscience,
increasingly leveraging modern generative methods like diffusion models to map
observed data to model parameters or future predictions. These approaches yield
posterior or posterior-predictive samples for new datasets without requiring
further simulator calls after training on simulated parameter-data pairs.
However, their applicability is often limited by the prior distribution(s) used
to generate model parameters during this training phase. To overcome this
constraint, we introduce PriorGuide, a technique specifically designed for
diffusion-based amortized inference methods. PriorGuide leverages a novel
guidance approximation that enables flexible adaptation of the trained
diffusion model to new priors at test time, crucially without costly
retraining. This allows users to readily incorporate updated information or
expert knowledge post-training, enhancing the versatility of pre-trained
inference models.

### [20] [Local Timescale Gates for Timescale-Robust Continual Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12843)
*Ansh Tiwari,Ayush Chauhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LT-Gate is a spiking neuron model that combines dual time-constant dynamics with adaptive gating to enable both fast adaptation and long-term memory in continual learning tasks, achieving 51% accuracy on temporal classification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking neural networks struggle with tasks requiring both fast adaptation and long-term memory in continual learning scenarios, creating a stability-plasticity dilemma that limits their performance compared to conventional deep networks.

Method: Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate) uses neurons that track information on fast and slow timescales in parallel, with a learned gate that locally adjusts their influence. It also includes variance-tracking regularization for firing activity stabilization.

Result: LT-Gate achieves about 51% final accuracy on challenging temporal classification benchmarks, outperforming recent Hebbian continual-learning baselines (46%) and prior SNN methods. It operates with local updates and is compatible with neuromorphic hardware like Intel's Loihi chip.

Conclusion: Multi-timescale gating substantially enhances continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the performance gap between spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks while maintaining hardware compatibility.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial
intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both
fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We
propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual
time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron
tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned
gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to
preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a
variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by
biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved
accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal
classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared
to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower
for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or
expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully
compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of
Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for
on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can
substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between
spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

### [21] [Lifting Manifolds to Mitigate Pseudo-Alignment in LLM4TS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12847)
*Liangwei Nathan Zheng,Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS models, identifies its root causes related to the cone effect and low-dimensional time series manifolds, and introduces TimeSUP to mitigate this issue and improve forecasting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pseudo-alignment causes LLM4TS models to underperform compared to simpler models, but there's limited understanding of why it occurs. The authors aim to thoroughly investigate the root causes and develop a solution.

Method: The authors conduct a thorough investigation into pseudo-alignment causes and introduce TimeSUP, a technique that increases time series manifold dimensions to match language embeddings' intrinsic dimension, allowing clear distinction of temporal signals while capturing shared structures.

Result: TimeSUP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and lightweight baselines on long-term forecasting performance. It can be seamlessly integrated into four existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements.

Conclusion: Pseudo-alignment arises from the interplay of cone effect in pretrained LLM components and low-dimensional time series manifolds. TimeSUP effectively mitigates this issue by better aligning the intrinsic dimensions, preserving modality uniqueness while learning commonalities.

Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for
time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to
linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited
discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In
this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of
pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the
cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the
interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically
low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce
\textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue
and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP
addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the
intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish
temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across
modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain
distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model
preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a
unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term
forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four
existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting
performance.

*Haolin Li,Hoda Bidkhori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGTEA is a federated class incremental learning framework that uses Gaussian task embeddings and Wasserstein distance alignment to handle task knowledge capture, uncertainty quantification, and privacy preservation in a scalable manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in federated class incremental learning including capturing task-specific knowledge, handling statistical heterogeneity, quantifying uncertainty, maintaining scalability across long task sequences, and preserving privacy while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Uses Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) to produce Gaussian-distributed task embeddings with fixed parameter size, and employs 2-Wasserstein distance on server side to measure inter-task gaps and enforce separation through Wasserstein loss formulation.

Result: Extensive evaluations show FedGTEA achieves superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting, consistently outperforming existing baselines on popular datasets.

Conclusion: FedGTEA provides an effective framework for federated class incremental learning that combines task knowledge capture, uncertainty quantification, privacy preservation, and scalability while achieving strong performance in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

*Alex Gower*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) use physical energy descent dynamics to accelerate machine learning, achieving competitive accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST while being robust to hardware constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent can accelerate machine learning by directly mirroring optimization processes, avoiding bottlenecks of conventional processors.

Method: Combines Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) with Equilibrium Propagation (EP) to enable local learning rules without global backpropagation, leveraging GHz-frequency dynamics that correspond to gradient descent and Langevin dynamics.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy: ~97.2% on MNIST and ~88.0% on Fashion-MNIST, while maintaining robustness under hardware constraints like parameter quantization and phase noise.

Conclusion: OIMs establish a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning, enabling practical realization of energy-based models on physical hardware that directly performs their optimization.

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route
to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify
this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of
energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while
intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well
as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into
descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules
without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive
accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on
Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware
constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results
establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning,
and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may
find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform
their optimization.

### [24] [Pruning Cannot Hurt Robustness: Certified Trade-offs in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12939)
*James Pedley,Benjamin Etheridge,Stephen J. Roberts,Francesco Quinzan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework showing that pruning neural network policies in reinforcement learning can improve certified robustness against adversarial attacks without compromising clean performance, and empirically demonstrates reproducible "sweet spots" where robustness improves substantially at moderate sparsity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL policies in real-world environments need to remain reliable under adversarial perturbations, while modern deep RL agents are over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns. The role of pruning in adversarial RL remains poorly understood despite its known benefits in supervised learning.

Method: Developed the first theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). Proved that element-wise pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds for Gaussian and categorical policies with Lipschitz networks. Derived a novel three-term regret decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced performance loss, and robustness gains.

Result: Empirical evaluation on continuous-control benchmarks with strong policy-aware adversaries showed that pruning consistently uncovers reproducible "sweet spots" at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean performance.

Conclusion: Pruning should be positioned not merely as a compression tool but as a structural intervention for robust RL, as it can improve robustness without compromising performance and reveals fundamental performance-robustness trade-offs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must
remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep
RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.
While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its
role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first
theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in
state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and
categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise
pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the
policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret
decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced
performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental
performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and
micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong
policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers
reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness
improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean
performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool
but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how standard training procedures yield well-calibrated models, as calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine learning but poorly understood in terms of theoretical foundations.

Method: Theoretical analysis of canonical L2-regularized empirical risk minimization, establishing finite-sample generalization bounds for smooth calibration error based on optimization error, regularization strength, and Rademacher complexity, with specific instantiation for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

Result: Proved that L2-regularized ERM directly controls smooth calibration error without post-hoc correction, derived concrete guarantees for kernel ridge and logistic regression, and experimentally confirmed these guarantees showing well-calibrated models without boosting or recalibration.

Conclusion: Standard L2-regularized empirical risk minimization provides theoretical guarantees for model calibration, eliminating the need for specialized calibration-promoting regularizers or post-hoc correction methods in many practical scenarios.

Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine
learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield
well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that
canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the
smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized
calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization
bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the
Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel
ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific
guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a
well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source

contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient
privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a
publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to
facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

Abstract: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent

*Athyrson Machado Ribeiro,Marcos Medeiros Raimundo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CI-EX framework for reject inference that identifies rejected client distributions using outlier detection and assigns labels based on proximity to accepted population, outperforming existing methods on RI-specific metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reject inference methods assume rejected client behavior can be extrapolated from accepted clients despite potential distributional differences, leading to blind extrapolation.

Method: Confident Inlier Extrapolation (CI-EX) framework that iteratively identifies rejected client distribution using outlier detection and assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to accepted population based on supervised classification probabilities.

Result: CI-EX consistently outperforms existing RI models on RI-specific metrics (Kickout, Area under Kickout) while maintaining competitive AUC performance across most experiments on two real-world credit datasets.

Conclusion: RI methods involve trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics, but CI-EX framework achieves superior performance on RI-specific metrics while maintaining competitive AUC, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing sample bias.

Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing
repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often
assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted
clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two
populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident
Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the
distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and
assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the
accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised
classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated
through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics
such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area
under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed
framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.
However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI
models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while
maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

### [29] [A Connection Between Score Matching and Local Intrinsic Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12975)
*Eric Yeats,Aaron Jacobson,Darryl Hannan,Yiran Jia,Timothy Doster,Henry Kvinge,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using denoising score matching loss as an efficient estimator for local intrinsic dimension (LID), showing it's competitive and scalable compared to existing methods that require multiple forward passes or gradient computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for quantifying LID in high-dimensional data using diffusion models are computationally expensive, requiring many forward passes or gradient computations, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: The authors demonstrate that LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss, motivating its use as a LID estimator. They also show the equivalent implicit score matching loss approximates LID via normal dimension and relates to the FLIPD estimator.

Result: Experiments on manifold benchmarks and Stable Diffusion 3.5 show that denoising score matching loss achieves superior accuracy and memory footprint under increasing problem size and quantization levels, making it highly competitive and scalable.

Conclusion: Denoising score matching loss serves as an effective and efficient LID estimator that outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and scalability while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in
signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of
high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent
works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the
spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their
density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can
accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the
diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in
compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,
motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.
Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also
approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent
LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable
Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly
competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory
footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning metrics rely on reference responses or classifiers, creating systematic blind spots where models appear successful but retain unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks.

Method: Proposes Functional Alignment for Distributional Equivalence (FADE) - a metric that compares bidirectional likelihood assignments over generated samples to measure distributional similarity between unlearned and reference models.

Result: Experiments on TOFU and UnlearnCanvas benchmarks show that methods achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold standard than before unlearning.

Conclusion: FADE exposes fundamental gaps in current evaluation practices and provides a more robust foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods by capturing functional alignment across the entire output distribution.

Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on
reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core
objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model
that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates
systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining
unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We
address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional
Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity
between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood
assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire
output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning.
Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas
benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods
achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve
distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold
standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in
current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust
foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

*Sikai Cheng,Reza Zandehshahvar,Haoruo Zhao,Daniel A. Garcia-Ulloa,Alejandro Villena-Rodriguez,Carles Navarro Manchón,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSI-4CAST is a hybrid deep learning architecture for CSI prediction that integrates CNN residuals, adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and Transformers to efficiently capture local and long-range dependencies, achieving superior accuracy with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for CSI prediction lack robustness to non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and computational efficiency. There is a need for more robust and efficient CSI prediction models.

Method: Proposes CSI-4CAST, a hybrid architecture combining 4 components: Convolutional neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and Transformers. Also introduces CSI-RRG benchmark with 300,000+ samples across 3,060 realistic scenarios for rigorous evaluation.

Result: Outperforms baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenarios, achieving best performance among all models while reducing FLOPs by 5x and 3x compared to strongest baseline LLM4CP.

Conclusion: CSI-4CAST provides superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost, and the CSI-RRG benchmark enables standardized evaluation of CSI prediction models across diverse channel conditions.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for
ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and
statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical
non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and
computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep
learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional
neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and
Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in
CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a
comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization
testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic
scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel
models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise
types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves
superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost,
outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario,
the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and
3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over
CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect
the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the
dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols
(https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a
standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and
efficient CSI prediction.

*Binxin Gao,Jingjun Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExtremBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' optimization reasoning capabilities through mathematical extremal problems, revealing discrepancies between general mathematical reasoning and specific extremal-solving skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand and evaluate the specific reasoning capabilities of LLMs in optimization problems, particularly extrema-finding under constraints, which is fundamental for applications like planning, control, and resource allocation.

Method: Created ExtremBench - a benchmark dataset with 93 standardized extrema-finding problems curated from Chinese Mathematical Olympiad inequality exercises, and conducted extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek.

Result: LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities don't always align with performance on current mathematical benchmarks like AIME25 and MATH-500, showing that strong general mathematical reasoning doesn't necessarily translate to strong extremal-solving skills, and vice versa.

Conclusion: Current evaluation benchmarks may not comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities, highlighting a critical gap in assessment practices for LLMs' optimization reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

*Kamaljyoti Nath,Additi Pandey,Bryan T. Susi,Hessam Babaee,George Em Karniadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMORE is a neural operator framework that uses adaptive loss functions and constraint enforcement to predict multiple thermochemical states for stiff reactive transport systems, enabling faster simulations in combustion and hypersonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stiff systems in combustion and hypersonics require extremely small time steps or computationally intensive methods. Neural operators can act as surrogates but need reliable learning strategies to handle error differences between output variables and samples.

Method: Developed AMORE framework with adaptive multi-output operator network, adaptive loss functions that consider state variable and sample errors, trunk design for Partition of Unity, and invertible analytical map to enforce mass-fraction constraints. Uses two-step training for DeepONet and extends to FNO.

Result: Successfully demonstrated on syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54) examples, showing efficacy in predicting thermochemical states from initial conditions.

Conclusion: AMORE provides a general framework for reliable operator learning in stiff systems, serving as a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate turbulent combustion simulations.

Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost
in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This
stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated
with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit
schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies
to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural
operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable
operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences
in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,
Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator
capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring
reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states
from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within
the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize
the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of
Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an
invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species
mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training
is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs
and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We
demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples:
the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The
proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate
turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in
addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.

*Francis Boabang,Samuel Asante Gyamerah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multistage reinforcement learning approach for single-cell perturbation modeling that combines natural gradient updates with proximal policy optimization to escape local optima and improve generalization in cellular response prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven models for cellular perturbation prediction often get trapped in local optima of the Waddington landscape, leading to spurious lineages and implausible differentiation outcomes, while current approaches lack proper initialization strategies to escape these local optima.

Method: A two-phase algorithm: first computes explicit natural gradient updates using Fisher-vector products and conjugate gradient solver with KL trust-region constraint for safe initialization, then applies proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped surrogates for policy refinement.

Result: The proposed initialization substantially improves generalization performance on both Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) perturbation analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The multistage reinforcement learning framework provides an effective data-driven approach with well-designed initialization that helps escape local optima and converge to proper cellular lineages in perturbation modeling.

Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a
central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have
advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically
conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,
these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of
cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in
spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable
gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design
frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,
an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to
escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this
work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for
single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural
gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,
scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the
first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we
then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped
surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We
demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing
(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

*Joshua R. Tempelman,Adam J. Wachtor,Eric B. Flynn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents an end-to-end machine learning workflow for automated ultrasonic weld inspection that addresses challenges of limited training data and environmental noise through reduced-order modeling, diffusion-based distribution alignment, and U-Net segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection faces significant challenges due to limited training data (from complex experimental specimen curation or high-fidelity simulations) and environmental volatility in industrial settings that corrupt measurements, making end-to-end ML workflows elusive.

Method: Proposes a workflow with: 1) reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory to generate comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects, 2) transfer learning using limited 3D elastodynamic simulations to refine inversion models, 3) guided diffusion to handle out-of-distribution experimental measurements by producing in-distribution representations of noisy LDV scans, and 4) U-Net-based segmentation and inversion.

Result: The integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data, successfully handling the challenges of data curation and signal corruption in industrial settings.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow addresses key bottlenecks in automated ultrasonic weld inspection by combining reduced-order modeling, diffusion-based distribution alignment, and deep learning techniques to create a practical end-to-end solution for industrial applications.

Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training
data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity
simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings
(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that combines deep learning, causal inference, and marketing science to overcome limitations of traditional Marketing Mix Modeling by automatically learning temporal patterns, channel dependencies, and saturation effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MMM approaches struggle with capturing complex temporal dynamics, non-linear saturation effects, and assume independence between marketing channels, limiting their effectiveness in modern marketing analytics.

Method: Uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for temporal pattern learning, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning for causal structures between channels, and Hill equation-based saturation curves. Features data-driven hyperparameter estimation, multi-region modeling, Huber loss, and advanced regularization.

Result: The package provides automated learning of adstock effects, lag patterns, and channel dependencies without manual specification. It enables comprehensive response curve analysis and offers 14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

Conclusion: DeepCausalMMM represents a significant advancement in MMM by integrating deep learning with causal inference, providing more accurate and automated marketing impact estimation while reducing reliance on manual heuristics and assumptions.

Abstract: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the
impact of marketing activities on business outcomes such as sales, revenue, or
customer visits. Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or
Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing
channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear
saturation effects [@Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian].
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by
combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The
package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal
patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously
learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between
marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning
[@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill
equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize
budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and
transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or
estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed
heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared
and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber
loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for
understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with
14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

*Xiaoyuan Cheng,Wenxuan Yuan,Yiming Yang,Yuanzhao Zhang,Sibo Cheng,Yi He,Zhuo Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an information-theoretic approach to Koopman operator learning that balances simplicity and expressiveness using mutual information and von Neumann entropy, leading to more stable and interpretable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Koopman learning methods face challenges in identifying suitable finite-dimensional subspaces due to suboptimal representation learning, where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity - a tension related to the information bottleneck dilemma.

Method: Proposes an information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances simplicity (promoted by latent mutual information) and expressiveness (sustained by von Neumann entropy). Develops a new algorithm based on this formulation to prevent latent space collapse and encourage mode diversity.

Result: The approach leads to stable and interpretable Koopman representations, with visualized manifolds showing empirical consistency with theoretical predictions. Validated across diverse dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman learning methods.

Conclusion: Information-theoretic principles provide an effective framework for Koopman learning, successfully addressing the tradeoff between simplicity and expressiveness through a balanced Lagrangian formulation that prevents mode collapse while maintaining predictive power.

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical
systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community.
However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable
finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We
argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,
where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This
tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:
constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.
Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent
mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may
cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,
expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such
collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an
information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this
tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian
formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a
stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative
evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our
representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of
dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman
learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.

*Anupam Nayak,Tong Yang,Osman Yagan,Gauri Joshi,Yuejie Chi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings, developing algorithms (OMG for Matrix games and SOMG for Markov games) that achieve improved sample efficiency with logarithmic regret scaling inversely with KL regularization strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical success of KL regularization in reinforcement learning and alignment tasks, the theoretical benefits in game-theoretic settings remain poorly understood. The authors aim to bridge this gap by developing provably efficient algorithms.

Method: The authors propose OMG algorithm for two-player zero-sum Matrix games using best response sampling with optimistic bonuses, and extend it to Markov games with SOMG algorithm that uses best response sampling and novel superoptimistic bonuses.

Result: Both algorithms achieve logarithmic regret in T that scales inversely with the KL regularization strength β, in addition to the standard Õ(√T) regret independent of β that is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical justification for KL regularization in game-theoretic settings, showing it can provably improve sample efficiency through algorithms that leverage the regularization strength to achieve better regret bounds.

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

TL;DR: An explainable AI framework that bridges high-resolution operational models and idealized coarse-grained models to improve Earth system simulations, particularly for extreme events and statistical distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Earth system models have persistent biases in simulating extreme events and statistical distributions, while different model types remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. There's a need to leverage complementary strengths of models with varying complexity.

Method: Developed an explainable AI framework using a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique that bridges model hierarchy. It exploits sparse output from idealized models to create a bridging model that inherits high resolution from operational models while achieving accuracy enhancements from idealized models.

Result: The framework significantly corrected biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Niño spatiotemporal patterns by leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. It provides global accuracy enhancements through targeted improvements.

Conclusion: The approach moves beyond black-box correction to physically insightful understanding, enabling effective physics-assisted digital twins and uncertainty quantification. It highlights the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing communication between modeling communities.

Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system.
While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they
exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and
statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate
fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in
characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different
models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an
explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model
hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely
suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting
bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of
operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through
targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI
provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box
correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally
efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly
correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns,
leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights
the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing

*Adil M. Bagirov,Ramiz M. Aliguliyev,Nargiz Sultanova,Sona Taheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel absolute cluster validity indices for evaluating cluster compactness and separability, addressing limitations of existing relative indices that depend on data structure and require comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cluster validity indices are typically relative, dependent on data structure, and used for comparing algorithms rather than directly identifying true clusters. They don't provide absolute measures of cluster quality.

Method: Defined a compactness function for each cluster and identified neighboring points between cluster pairs. Used these to calculate cluster compactness, distribution compactness, inter-cluster margins, and overall distribution margins.

Result: The proposed indices successfully identified the true number of clusters in both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating competitive performance compared to widely-used cluster validity indices.

Conclusion: The novel absolute cluster indices provide effective measures for determining cluster compactness and separability, enabling direct identification of optimal cluster numbers without requiring algorithm comparisons.

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

Motivation: To improve Stochastic Gradient Descent by addressing convergence speed and overfitting issues through interpolation-based acceleration and noise regularization techniques.

Method: Developed IAGD using second-order Newton interpolation to accelerate convergence by leveraging gradient relevance between iterations, and NRSGD that introduces controlled noise to gradients for regularization. Tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with various CNNs.

Result: Comparative experiments showed both IAGD and NRSGD outperformed classical optimizers from Keras Package, demonstrating their effectiveness as viable improvements to standard SGD.

Conclusion: The two proposed SGD variants - IAGD for faster convergence and NRSGD for better regularization - represent effective advancements in optimization methods with demonstrated performance improvements on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the paper introduces two
optimizers, named Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) as well
as Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD leverages
second-order Newton Interpolation to expedite the convergence process during
training, assuming relevancy in gradients between iterations. To avoid
over-fitting, NRSGD incorporates a noise regularization technique that
introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process.
Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks)
with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results
demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD,
implicating the effectiveness of the advancements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Global MetNet is a machine learning model for global precipitation nowcasting that addresses forecast disparities between Global North and South by using satellite and NWP data, achieving high-resolution 12-hour forecasts in under a minute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for timely precipitation forecasts in the Global South where traditional NWP methods have high latency and low resolution, and where radar coverage is too sparse for existing ML methods to work effectively.

Method: Leverages Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for 12 hours at 0.05° (~5km) spatial resolution and 15-minute temporal resolution using machine learning.

Result: Significantly outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts, achieves higher skill than best high-resolution NWP models in data-sparse regions, shows improvements across key metrics (critical success index, fractions skill score), and generates forecasts in under a minute.

Conclusion: Global MetNet represents a key step in reducing global forecast disparities and integrating sparse satellite observations into weather forecasting, with real-time deployment already serving millions of users on Google Search.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions
skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model
generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for
real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google

### [43] [Neural Triangular Transport Maps: A New Approach Towards Sampling in Lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13112)
*Andrey Bryutkin,Youssef Marzouk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes sparse triangular transport maps using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN) to efficiently sample lattice field theories by exploiting conditional independence structures, achieving linear time complexity while maintaining expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lattice field theories face sampling challenges due to multimodality and long-range correlations. Normalizing flows offer promise but encounter memory constraints and expressivity issues when applied to large lattices.

Method: Sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly exploit conditional independence structure using MRNN, with a framework balancing exact sparsity (respecting conditional independence) and approximate sparsity (computational tractability). Each map component is restricted to local past for parallel evaluation.

Result: Achieves linear time complexity in lattice size N while preserving invertible structure. Analyzes how node labelings affect sparsity and performance using φ⁴ in 2D as test case.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient alternative to Hybrid Monte Carlo and established flow methods like RealNVP for sampling lattice field theories, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

### [44] [Time-Varying Optimization for Streaming Data Via Temporal Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13052)
*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes time-varying optimization for streaming data using weighted formulations, comparing uniform and discounted weighting strategies under gradient descent, with theoretical bounds on tracking error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address decision-making in dynamic environments where classical optimization with fixed objectives is insufficient, focusing specifically on streaming data scenarios.

Method: Introduces a structured weight-based formulation for time-varying optimization, analyzing two weighting strategies (uniform and discounted) under gradient descent updates, with theoretical derivation of tracking error bounds.

Result: Uniform weighting achieves asymptotic vanishing of tracking error with O(1/t) decay rate, while discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by discount factor and gradient update frequency.

Conclusion: The choice between uniform and discounted weighting involves trade-offs between asymptotic optimality and adaptability to changing environments, with theoretical guarantees validated through simulations.

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

### [45] [Assessing the robustness of heterogeneous treatment effects in survival analysis under informative censoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13397)
*Yuxin Wang,Dennis Frauen,Jonas Schweisthal,Maresa Schröder,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for assessing robustness of conditional average treatment effect estimates in survival analysis under informative censoring bias, using partial identification to derive bounds rather than point estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dropout in clinical studies causes informative censoring bias that biases treatment effect estimates. Existing methods rely on strong assumptions like non-informative censoring for point estimation.

Method: Proposed an assumption-lean framework using partial identification to derive bounds on CATE. Developed a novel meta-learner that estimates bounds using arbitrary ML models with double robustness and quasi-oracle efficiency properties.

Result: The framework identifies patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite informative censoring. Demonstrated practical value through numerical experiments and cancer drug trial application.

Conclusion: Provides a practical tool for assessing robustness of treatment effects in presence of censoring, promoting reliable use of survival data in medicine and epidemiology.

Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving
early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,
dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which
treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an
assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring
bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as
non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial
identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework
helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite
informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates
the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable
theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle
efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through
numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,
our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable
use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.

*Konstantinos Barmpas,Na Lee,Alexandros Koliousis,Yannis Panagakis,Dimitrios A. Adamos,Nikolaos Laskaris,Stefanos Zafeiriou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroRVQ is a new EEG foundation model with a codebook-based tokenizer that better preserves high-frequency neural dynamics through multi-scale feature extraction, hierarchical residual vector quantization, and phase-amplitude aware loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG foundation models have limited performance due to poor signal tokenization that fails to preserve high-frequency dynamics, hindering accurate EEG signal reconstruction.

Method: Developed NeuroRVQ with multi-scale feature extraction, hierarchical residual vector quantization codebooks, and EEG phase-amplitude aware loss function for efficient training and high-fidelity signal reconstruction.

Result: NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms existing large brainwave models on various downstream tasks, establishing a strong prior for codebook-based brainwave models.

Conclusion: NeuroRVQ's tokenizer enables efficient EEG compression with accurate reconstruction across all frequency bands, advancing neural decoding, generative modeling, and multimodal biosignal integration.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

*Thomas van Vuren,Fiona Sloothaak,Maarten G. Wolf,Jaron Sanders*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a two-phase RL algorithm for Block Markov Decision Processes that first learns latent structure through clustering, then uses optimism-guided exploration, achieving O(√T+n) regret which improves upon prior O(√T+n²) bounds and is asymptotically optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the curse of dimensionality in RL by exploiting structural properties of environments with large observation spaces but simpler latent dynamics, and to formally analyze how clustering-based latent state recovery can accelerate learning.

Method: A two-phase algorithm: (1) learn latent structure through random exploration and clustering methods, (2) switch to optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure.

Result: Achieves O(√T+n) regret on BMDPs susceptible to clustering, improving the prior O(√T+n²) bound. Proves this is asymptotically optimal - no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this class.

Conclusion: Accurate latent state estimation through clustering can effectively speed up RL learning in structured environments, and the proposed algorithm achieves optimal performance on the studied class of BMDPs.

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical
in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces.
Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate
learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision
Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but
where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent
advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this
latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to
determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now
addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages
clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed
effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first
learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an
optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm
achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible
to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the
cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds
up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior
bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that
no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.
This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic
optimality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised deep learning framework using Transformer for downlink beamforming in MU-MISO systems, achieving fast inference and competitive performance with WMMSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time beamforming in dynamic communication environments through offline training and lightweight inference, overcoming limitations of traditional iterative optimization methods.

Method: Multi-layer Transformer with residual connections for iterative refinement of channel and beamformer features, enhanced by curriculum learning, semi-amortized learning, and sliding-window training strategies.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at high SNRs, with substantially faster inference than iterative and online learning approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised deep learning framework provides an effective solution for real-time beamforming with competitive performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

TL;DR: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text are shown to be computationally equivalent to polynomially-padded looped transformers and can solve all problems that chain-of-thought transformers can solve, with inherent efficiency advantages for certain problem classes like regular languages due to parallel generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the computational capabilities and limitations of masked diffusion models for text, which offer parallel generation as an alternative to traditional autoregressive language models, but whose reasoning abilities remain largely unexplored.

Method: Connecting MDMs to established reasoning frameworks (chain of thought and padded looped transformers) in the finite-precision log-width setting, proving equivalence relationships and analyzing computational efficiency.

Result: MDMs are equivalent to polynomially-padded looped transformers in this setting, can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can, and are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers for certain problem classes including regular languages.

Conclusion: Masked diffusion models represent a powerful alternative to autoregressive models with provable reasoning capabilities and efficiency advantages for parallelizable problems, establishing their theoretical foundations in computational linguistics.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reducing total time required to complete various learning tasks in federated learning within mobile edge computing environments, particularly under dependent multi-task settings where tasks have interdependencies.

Method: Uses Earth Mover's Distance for client clustering based on local data distributions, establishes relationship between intra-cluster EMD and training rounds, and implements directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling for dependency management.

Result: Numerical experiments show CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks with faster convergence, lower communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under heterogeneous MEC settings.

Conclusion: The proposed CoDa-FL framework effectively reduces total training time in federated learning by combining cluster-based client selection with dependency-aware task assignment, demonstrating superior performance in mobile edge computing environments.

Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within
mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent
multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various
learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware
framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client
selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's
Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to
lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a
direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of
training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise
complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate
a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage
task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed
CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower
communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under
heterogeneous MEC settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes dropout regularization in continuous-time models using random-batch methods, establishing convergence rates, stability properties, and deriving optimal time step size for computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a theoretical framework for dropout regularization in continuous-time neural networks by leveraging random-batch methods from particle systems, providing rigorous convergence guarantees and optimal parameter selection.

Method: Constructs an unbiased estimator that mimics dropout by sampling neuron batches over time intervals, analyzes trajectory convergence and distribution stability, performs adjoint analysis for training dynamics, and compares different batch sampling schemes.

Result: Establishes linear convergence rate for expected uniform error, total-variation error of order h^{1/2} for distribution stability, bounds deviations in optimal cost and control during training, and derives closed-form optimal time step h based on cost-accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: The random-batch dropout approach provides rigorous theoretical guarantees, effective regularization, and computational efficiency, with validation on neural ODEs showing predicted rates and favorable runtime/memory performance.

Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of
random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally
devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We
construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling
neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence
is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the
distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity
equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment
assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a
Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and
control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we
compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover
standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy
trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a
single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow
matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable
runtime and memory profiles.

TL;DR: Proposes a quasi-dynamic framework for program representation that models optimization sensitivity using Program Behavior Spectrum, encoded via compositional learning with PQ-BERT Transformer model, achieving SOTA performance on compiler optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dilemma between static representations (efficient but limited insight) and dynamic representations (insightful but impractical) for program embeddings in compiler optimization.

Method: Generate Program Behavior Spectrum by probing IR with diverse optimization sequences, quantify static feature changes, use Product Quantization to discretize reaction vectors, and train PQ-BERT Transformer model to learn behavioral codes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines on Best Pass Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction compiler optimization tasks.

Conclusion: The quasi-dynamic framework successfully transcends the static-dynamic trade-off, providing efficient yet insightful program representations for compiler optimization.

Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient framework for constructing complete equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that achieves universal approximation of equivariant functions through a canonical form and full-rank steerable basis, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing equivariant GNNs achieve completeness through deeper architectures, higher body orders, or increased steerable features, which leads to high computational costs and lack of polynomial-time solutions. There is a need for more efficient and practical approaches to build complete equivariant GNNs.

Method: The framework constructs complete equivariant GNNs using two key components: 1) a complete scalar function (canonical form of geometric graph), and 2) a full-rank steerable basis set. The method is applied to common models like EGNN and TFN with an efficient algorithm.

Result: Empirical results show the proposed model achieves superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few layers, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining strong practical efficacy compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretically grounded and practical framework for building complete equivariant GNNs that are both efficient and effective, addressing the computational limitations of previous methods while achieving the universal approximation property.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant
success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the
universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the
network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among
different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented
body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high
computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we
present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete
equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete
equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete
scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and
2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an
efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two
common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model
demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few
layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining
strong practical efficacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Cross-modal Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH) to explain when cross-modal knowledge distillation works, proposing that it's effective when teacher-student mutual information exceeds student-label mutual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite successes in cross-modal knowledge distillation, there's limited theoretical understanding of why it sometimes fails, creating a gap between practice and theory that needs addressing.

Method: The authors propose the CCH hypothesis, theoretically validate it using a joint Gaussian model, and empirically test it across diverse multimodal datasets including image, text, video, audio, and omics data.

Result: The study validates the CCH both theoretically and empirically, showing that cross-modal KD effectiveness depends on the relationship between teacher-student mutual information and student-label mutual information.

Conclusion: The research establishes a theoretical framework for understanding cross-modal KD and provides practical guidelines for selecting optimal teacher modalities based on the CCH criterion.

Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant
interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer
"teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during
model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across
various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved
outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could
inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal
Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective
when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds
the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We
theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it
empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video,
audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical
framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines
based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving
the performance of weaker modalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CleverCatch is a knowledge-guided weak supervision model that integrates domain expertise with neural networks to detect healthcare fraud, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by combining expert rules with data-driven learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare fraud detection faces challenges from limited labeled data, evolving fraud tactics, and high-dimensional medical records. Traditional supervised methods struggle with label scarcity, while unsupervised approaches often miss clinically meaningful anomalies.

Method: The approach integrates structured domain expertise into a neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples in a shared embedding space. It trains encoders jointly on synthetic compliance and violation data to learn soft rule embeddings that generalize to real-world datasets.

Result: Experiments on large-scale real-world data show CleverCatch outperforms four state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, with average improvements of 1.3% in AUC and 3.4% in recall. Ablation studies confirm the complementary role of expert rules.

Conclusion: Embedding expert rules into the learning process improves detection accuracy and increases transparency, offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains like healthcare fraud detection.

Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high
dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are
challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches
often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we
introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to
detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

### [56] [Performance Evaluation of Ising and QUBO Variable Encodings in Boltzmann Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13210)
*Yasushi Hasegawa,Masayuki Ohzeki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of Ising and QUBO encodings for Boltzmann machine learning reveals systematic differences in Fisher information matrix structure. QUBO creates more ill-conditioned curvature, slowing SGD convergence, while NGD achieves similar performance across encodings due to reparameterization invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different variable encodings ({-1,+1} Ising vs {0,1} QUBO) affect the information geometry and learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines, and to provide practical guidance for encoding selection and preprocessing.

Method: Controlled comparison protocol fixing model, sampler, and step size. Analysis of Fisher information matrix (FIM) structure using empirical moments from model samples. Comparison of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and natural gradient descent (NGD) performance across encodings.

Result: QUBO encoding induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating more small-eigenvalue directions in FIM and lowering spectral entropy, leading to slower SGD convergence. NGD achieves similar convergence across encodings due to reparameterization invariance. Ising encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster SGD convergence.

Conclusion: For SGD-based training, Ising encoding is preferable due to better-conditioned curvature. For QUBO encoding, centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning can mitigate curvature issues. Representation choice significantly impacts information geometry and finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines.

Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine
learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step
size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals
the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from
model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO
induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating
more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This
ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by
the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to
reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising
encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO,
centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies.
These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and
finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable
guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

### [57] [Towards Understanding Valuable Preference Data for Large Language Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13212)
*Zizhuo Zhang,Qizhou Wang,Shanshan Ye,Jianing Zhu,Jiangchao Yao,Bo Han,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach for selecting high-quality preference data for LLM alignment, showing that data quality is model-dependent and proposing computationally efficient scoring functions to improve data selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for selecting preference data for LLM alignment often use external models and don't assess whether individual data points are genuinely beneficial to specific models, leading to suboptimal alignment performance.

Method: Proposed truncated influence function (TIF) to assess individual data point influence, developed two simpler scoring functions correlated with TIF, and created a combined selection rule to offset individual scoring function errors.

Result: Experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and LLM families showed that better alignment performance can be achieved using less data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: Preference data quality is inherently model-dependent, and the proposed model-adaptive data selection approach enables more precise selection of valuable preference data for improved LLM alignment.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

### [58] [Rethinking Graph Domain Adaptation: A Spectral Contrastive Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13254)
*Haoyu Zhang,Yuxuan Cheng,Wenqi Fan,Yulong Chen,Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FracNet is a frequency-aware contrastive graph network that addresses domain adaptation in GNNs by decomposing graphs into low-frequency (global) and high-frequency (local) components, using spectral analysis and contrastive learning to handle structural distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs struggle with domain adaptation due to structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable patterns. They fail to distinguish between global and local patterns, leading to loss of local details after multi-layer processing.

Method: Proposes FracNet with two synergic modules: decomposes graphs into high-frequency (domain-specific local details) and low-frequency (domain-invariant global patterns) components using spectral analysis, and integrates contrastive learning to address blurring boundary problems in domain adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in domain adaptation tasks.

Conclusion: FracNet effectively handles domain shifts in graph neural networks through frequency-aware decomposition and contrastive learning, with both practical success and theoretical validation of its superiority.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant
structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable
patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do
not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details
in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that
domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where
low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and
high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we
propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware
\underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two
synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and
low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover,
the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating
with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we
also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of
FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the parametric efficiency bottleneck in perspective-aware classification that hasn't been sufficiently recognized in existing studies.

Method: Apply hypernetwork+adapters combination to perspectivist classification, creating an architecture-agnostic solution that works with various base models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient, parameter-light solution for perspective-aware classification that can be broadly applied to different base models.

Abstract: The task of perspective-aware classification introduces a bottleneck in terms
of parametric efficiency that did not get enough recognition in existing
studies. In this article, we aim to address this issue by applying an existing
architecture, the hypernetwork+adapters combination, to perspectivist
classification. Ultimately, we arrive at a solution that can compete with
specialized models in adopting user perspectives on hate speech and toxicity
detection, while also making use of considerably fewer parameters. Our solution
is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of base models out
of the box.

*Alejandro Guerra-Manzanares,Omar El-Herraoui,Michail Maniatakos,Farah E. Shamout*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BlendFL is a novel federated learning framework that combines horizontal and vertical FL principles to handle multimodal data heterogeneity, allowing clients to benefit from both approaches simultaneously based on their available data, with decentralized inference and adaptive aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL frameworks struggle with real-world multimodal data heterogeneity where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented across clients, creating gaps in collaborative learning without data sharing.

Method: BlendFL seamlessly blends horizontal and vertical FL principles in synchronized fashion, features decentralized inference for local model execution, and uses BlendAvg adaptive global model aggregation that prioritizes updates based on client performance.

Result: BlendFL demonstrated superior performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification on large-scale medical dataset and benchmark, with faster convergence and accelerated collaborative learning compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: BlendFL shows strong potential for handling multimodal data heterogeneity in privacy-sensitive real-world settings like healthcare and finance, overcoming limitations of traditional FL approaches.

Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data
sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While
Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients,
existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in
`ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to
address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented
across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a
novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and
vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry
across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either
of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.
In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering
clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,
thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also
introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that
prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We
trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three
classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset
and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior
performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies
demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches,
accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the
potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for
collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial,
such as in healthcare and finance.

*Anna Hedström,Salim I. Amoukou,Tom Bewley,Saumitra Mishra,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERA is a framework for steering language models to reduce errors through optimized, calibrated interventions that determine when and how much to steer, improving performance or abstaining when confident corrections aren't possible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use fixed, manually tuned steering strengths that often lead to under or oversteering, limiting their effectiveness in error correction.

Method: MERA optimizes intervention direction and calibrates when and how much to steer, allowing for selective, adaptive interventions that can abstain when no confident correction is possible.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets and LM families show safe, effective, non-degrading error correction, with MERA outperforming existing baselines and being applicable on top of existing steering techniques.

Conclusion: MERA establishes itself as a general-purpose, efficient approach to mechanistic activation steering that provably improves performance through calibrated interventions.

Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

### [62] [Federated Conditional Conformal Prediction via Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13297)
*Rui Xu,Sihong Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fed-CCP is a federated conformal prediction method that uses generative models to achieve conditional coverage across heterogeneous clients while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction assumes i.i.d. data, which fails in federated learning where client distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods only provide marginal coverage per client, lacking input-conditional uncertainty adaptation.

Method: Proposes Federated Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) using generative models (normalizing flows or diffusion models) to approximate conditional data distributions without sharing raw data. Each client locally calibrates conformal scores reflecting their unique uncertainty, with global consistency maintained through federated aggregation.

Result: Experiments on real datasets show that Fed-CCP achieves more adaptive prediction sets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Fed-CCP successfully addresses the limitations of standard CP in federated settings by providing conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity while maintaining privacy through generative model-based distribution approximation.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty
quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the
true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated
learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP
assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client
distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this
by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail
to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated
Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims
for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP
leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to
approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw
data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that
reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through
federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP
achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

*Alessandro Brusaferri,Andrea Ballarino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using conformal prediction to improve uncertainty quantification in generative diffusion models for meteorological downscaling, addressing overconfident predictions and providing finite-sample guarantees for grid-point-level uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative diffusion models lack finite-sample guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated grid-point-level uncertainty estimates that hinder reliability in operational weather forecasting and renewable energy applications.

Method: Augment the downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework that post-processes diffusion model samples to derive conditional quantile estimates, incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure for locally adaptive prediction intervals.

Result: Evaluation on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy downscaled to 2-km grid shows markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores compared to the diffusion model baseline, with grid-point-level uncertainty estimates achieving finite-sample marginal validity.

Conclusion: Conformalized generative models show potential for more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological fields by providing reliable uncertainty quantification with finite-sample guarantees.

Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling.
Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven
tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable
sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample
guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated
grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in
operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the
downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the
DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates,
incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting
locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The
proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for
more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological
fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods face challenges including conflicting distributional assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different anomaly types.

Method: ISER extends isolation-based methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics, constructs ensemble representations, and introduces a novel similarity-based scoring method that compares against theoretical anomaly reference patterns.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance over 11 baseline methods.

Conclusion: ISER effectively addresses fundamental challenges in anomaly detection while maintaining computational efficiency and improving detection performance.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with
applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring.
Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods
still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional
assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different
anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based
Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based
methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics
while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs
ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information:
smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse
areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures
pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical
anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of
Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address
axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance
over 11 baseline methods.

TL;DR: RockNet is a distributed TinyML method for ultra-low-power microcontrollers that enables on-device training for timeseries classification without offline pretraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing memory, latency and energy consumption by up to 90% when scaling to 20 devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As ML becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), there is growing need to shift training from cloud to on-device processing due to privacy and latency concerns, but ultra-low-power microcontrollers' limited compute resources make training challenging.

Result: Hardware experiments on 20 ultra-low-power devices show RockNet learns timeseries classification tasks from scratch, surpassing latest neural network microcontroller training accuracy by up to 2x, and reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90% when scaling from 1 to 20 devices.

Conclusion: A tight integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with state-of-the-art accuracy.

Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to
on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency
concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose
limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents
RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault

CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that
integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for
distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need
minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and
efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes
the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.
Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate

*Lina Alkarmi,Ziyuan Huang,Mingyan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how classifier abstention (declining decisions when confidence is low) affects strategic classification, showing it improves accuracy and deters manipulation in Stackelberg game settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algorithmic decision making is vulnerable to strategic manipulation, and prior research showed abstention increases classifier accuracy. This paper explores how abstention impacts strategic agents' responses and how principals should optimally use it.

Method: The interaction is modeled as a Stackelberg game where a principal (classifier) announces its decision policy first, then strategic agents manipulate their features to get desired outcomes. Focuses on binary classifiers where agents manipulate observable rather than true features.

Result: Optimal abstention ensures the principal's utility is no worse than in non-abstention settings, even with strategic agents. Abstention improves accuracy and serves as a manipulation deterrent, making it costlier for less qualified agents to manipulate when costs significantly affect behavior.

Conclusion: Abstention is a valuable tool for reducing negative effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems, providing both accuracy improvements and manipulation deterrence.

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

TL;DR: ToSFiT is a scalable Bayesian optimization method for large discrete spaces that uses Thompson sampling via fine-tuning of large language models, eliminating the need for acquisition function maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is computationally expensive due to the absence of gradients and the high cost of maximizing acquisition functions.

Method: Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) parameterizes the probability that a candidate yields maximum reward, leveraging prompt-conditioned LLMs and incrementally adapting them toward the posterior distribution.

Result: The method achieves strong theoretical regret bounds matching standard Thompson sampling and shows significant sample efficiency improvements with negligible computational impact across FAQ response refinement, protein search, and quantum circuit design tasks.

Conclusion: Online fine-tuning of LLMs for Thompson sampling provides an effective approach for Bayesian optimization in large discrete spaces, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical success.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches discard incomplete data or use imputation preprocessing, leading to information loss and biased similarity estimates in web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis.

Method: Proposes proximity kernel with data-dependent binning and proximity assignment to project data into high-dimensional sparse representation, plus cascading fallback strategy for missing value handling.

Result: Superior performance in clustering tasks across 12 real-world incomplete datasets compared to existing methods, while maintaining linear time complexity.

Conclusion: Proximity kernel provides an effective similarity measure for incomplete data without explicit imputation, achieving better performance with efficient computation.

Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in
web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional
approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a
preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity
estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure
that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature
space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method
introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project
data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density
variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback
strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks
on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while
maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generalist framework addresses adversarial training limitations by partitioning generalization goals among specialized base learners and interpolating their parameters to form a global learner, achieving better generalization and reduced trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial training suffers from significant natural accuracy degradation and poor cross-attack robustness transfer, requiring solutions that address both issues simultaneously.

Method: Partition generalization goals into sub-tasks assigned to dedicated base learners, then interpolate their parameters to form a global learner while periodically redistributing global parameters back to prevent optimization drift.

Result: Achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates trade-off problems compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Generalist provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers by effectively managing the specialization-interpolation balance in adversarial training.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are popular in offline and model-based RL but remain underexplored in online model-free RL due to sensitivity to training setups and model design decisions.

Method: Investigated key design questions including input conditioning, component sharing between actor and critic, and sequential data slicing for training.

Result: Found stable architectural and training strategies that enable competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks in both vector- and image-based settings.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidance for applying transformers in online reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based

share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dependency modeling and anomaly detection method for cloud services that integrates contrastive learning, graph convolution, and temporal consistency constraints to handle complex dependencies and diverse anomaly patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of complex dependencies and diverse anomaly patterns in cloud service environments that traditional methods struggle to handle effectively.

Method: Abstracts service interactions into dependency graphs, extracts temporal/structural features via embedding functions, uses graph convolution for neighborhood aggregation, and employs contrastive learning with positive/negative sample pairs and temporal consistency constraints.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC metrics while maintaining robustness under sparse labeling, monitoring noise, and traffic fluctuations.

Conclusion: Verifies effectiveness of integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides complete technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong adaptability and stability in complex environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of

### [72] [Prediction Markets with Intermittent Contributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13385)
*Michael Vitali,Pierre Pinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A prediction market framework for collaborative forecasting that handles data ownership issues, adapts to dynamic conditions, allows flexible agent participation, and uses robust regression with performance-based payoff allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of collaborative forecasting when stakeholders have data ownership concerns and competitive interests, overcoming limitations of cooperative game-theoretic approaches.

Method: Propose a prediction market design using robust regression models to optimally combine forecasts while handling missing submissions, with a payoff mechanism considering both in-sample and out-of-sample performance.

Result: The market design effectively handles time-varying conditions and flexible agent participation, demonstrating effectiveness through case studies with simulated and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed prediction market framework provides a viable solution for collaborative forecasting that respects data ownership while ensuring fair payoff allocation and adaptability to dynamic environments.

Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are
increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data
ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within
cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general
framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade
forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and
analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of
the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting
agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust
regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling
missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that
considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several
desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data
allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market
design.

### [73] [Going with the Flow: Approximating Banzhaf Values via Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13391)
*Benjamin Kempinski,Tal Kachman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate Banzhaf values in network flow games, achieving high-fidelity approximation with significant speedups and strong zero-shot generalization across different network configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact computation of Banzhaf values in network flow games is intractable for systems with more than ~20 agents due to exponential complexity, while Monte Carlo sampling methods suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations.

Method: The authors use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values by framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task. They compare three GNN architectures - Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv - on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration.

Result: Trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, the models show strong zero-shot generalization, accurately predicting Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems, enabling efficient computation of agent influence in large-scale or dynamic systems.

Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for
quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging
from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is
intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential
complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide
statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot
transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them
impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel
learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate
Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a
graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent
influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN
architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with
Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of
200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count
(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained
GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most
significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on
graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for
entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring
retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable
cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.

*Muhammad Ishfaq Hussain,Ma Van Linh,Zubia Naz,Unse Fatima,Yeongmin Ko,Moongu Jeon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to synthetically generate SWIR-like images from LWIR data and proposes a multimodal fusion framework combining synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities using an optimized encoder-decoder network with modality-specific encoders and softmax-gated fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional RGB and thermal infrared fusion in adverse visibility conditions by leveraging SWIR imaging's ability to penetrate atmospheric disturbances, while overcoming the scarcity of publicly available SWIR datasets.

Method: Synthetic generation of SWIR-like images from LWIR data using contrast enhancement techniques, followed by multimodal fusion framework with modality-specific encoders and softmax-gated fusion head in an optimized encoder-decoder neural network architecture.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show improved fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance, outperforming existing trimodal baselines.

Conclusion: The synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion framework demonstrates substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and autonomous systems, effectively addressing adverse visibility challenges.

Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a
critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.
Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /
LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,
particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate
illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging
has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric
disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the
advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face
significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR
datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to
synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming
spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast
enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework
integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized
encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and
a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR
benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real
RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion
framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural
fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal
baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of
U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight
substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and
autonomous systems.

### [75] [Optimizing Storage Overhead of User Behavior Log for ML-embedded Mobile Apps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13405)
*Chen Gong,Yan Zhuang,Zhenzhe Zheng,Yiliu Chen,Sheng Wang,Fan Wu,Guihai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaLog is a lightweight system that reduces storage costs for user behavior logs in ML-embedded mobile apps by eliminating redundant data and optimizing storage layout, achieving 19-44% size reduction with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models in mobile apps require extensive user behavior data, which imposes substantial storage costs leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. Current practices suffer from redundant logging across features and sparse storage from heterogeneous attributes.

Method: AdaLog formulates redundant data elimination as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, uses a hierarchical algorithm for on-device deployment, employs virtually hashed attributes for dense storage, and implements incremental updates for dynamic behavior patterns.

Result: AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44% with minimal system overhead (2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage) when deployed in popular mobile apps using real-world user data.

Conclusion: AdaLog provides an efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device ML by significantly reducing storage requirements while maintaining model inference accuracy and latency.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile
apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically
rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture
user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording
necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,
leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this
storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system
designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded
mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We
identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user
behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across
different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing
behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To
solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level
redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and
proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,
AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous
behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to
ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an
incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting
outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into
popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on
real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%
with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),
providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device
ML.

*Lucas Maystre,Alvaro Ortega Gonzalez,Charles Park,Rares Dolga,Tudor Berariu,Yu Zhao,Kamil Ciosek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that embedding models can be made interoperable through orthogonal transformations when pairwise dot products are preserved, and demonstrates this with Procrustes post-processing for applications like model retraining and multimodal search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedding models trained on similar data produce representations that encode stable information but are not directly interchangeable, creating challenges for practical applications like model retraining, partial upgrades, and multimodal search.

Method: The study proves that if pairwise dot products are approximately preserved between two embedding sets, there exists an isometry that closely aligns them. This leads to using Procrustes post-processing to make embedding models interoperable while preserving each space's geometry.

Result: Empirical demonstrations show the method's effectiveness in maintaining compatibility across retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving mixed-modality search, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Orthogonal transformations can successfully align embedding models when pairwise dot products are preserved, enabling interoperability through Procrustes post-processing while maintaining geometric properties of the embedding spaces.

Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce
representations that encode stable information but are not directly
interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several
practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and
multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of
embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if
pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an
isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the
alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes
post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving
the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across
retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving
mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Kayode Olumoyin,Katarzyna Rejniak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modified PINN framework is applied to oncology for learning time-varying interactions in combination therapy using sparse tumor volume data, incorporating biological constraints as regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sparse experimental data in oncology (few time points of tumor volume) by embedding prior knowledge about dynamical systems into neural networks to improve learning and generalization.

Method: Extend physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by incorporating observed biological constraints as regularization agents, applied to an ODE model of combination therapy with intermittent treatment.

Result: The modified PINN algorithm successfully learns dynamics of treatment, yields solutions to the ODE, and identifies time-varying ODE model parameters with strong convergence demonstrated by low MSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed PINN framework effectively handles sparse oncology data by incorporating biological constraints, enabling accurate learning of combination therapy dynamics and parameter estimation with limited training examples.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the
laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss
function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to
oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination
therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often
sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding
inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we
extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed
biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is
able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only
a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning
the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution
to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We
demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error
(MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

*Ashish Bhatia,Renato Cordeiro de Amorim,Vito De Feo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel hybrid fuzzy regression method combining Mamdani's interpretability with TSK's precision, using dual dominance types and hybrid rule structure to balance accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional regression struggles with uncertainty and ambiguity in real-world data, while deep learning lacks interpretability and risks over-fitting. Fuzzy systems offer uncertainty handling but face interpretability-accuracy trade-offs.

Method: Hybrid fuzzy regression with Mamdani-TSK combination, featuring dual dominance types and rule structure with both fuzzy and crisp components.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: best fuzzy methodology in 4/6 datasets, outperformed opaque models in 2 datasets, best overall score in 1 dataset, with RMSE improvements from 0.4% to 19%.

Conclusion: The hybrid methodology provides a balanced tool for predictive modeling that addresses the interpretability-accuracy trade-off in fuzzy systems.

Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships
between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is
widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and
engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data
complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning
approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack
interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide
an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani
and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:
interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression
method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision
of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with
fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy
and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a
component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision
through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and
versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets
tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4
datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best
overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to
19%.

*Jiaxing Deng,Junbiao Pang,Zhicheng Wang,Haitao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An unsupervised low-rank method for correcting GPS point errors in parking spot locations by leveraging physical constraints that parking spots are parallel to road sides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPS points for parking spots often drift due to high-rise buildings and inherent GPS equipment errors, making accurate location data essential for parking management and urban development applications.

Method: Proposes an unsupervised low-rank method that uses physical constraints (parking spots parallel to road sides) to rectify GPS errors and align points to actual parking spots in a unified framework.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's superiority in solving practical GPS point correction problems for parking spots.

Conclusion: The proposed method is simple yet effective for correcting various types of GPS point errors in parking spot locations, with publicly available dataset and code.

Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-augmented algorithm using Transformers to predict minimal monomial bases for Sum of Squares (SOS) polynomial certification, achieving 100x speedups over state-of-the-art solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Certifying polynomial nonnegativity via SOS is NP-hard and computationally expensive due to large SDPs with quadratic growth in monomial basis size. Existing methods struggle with scalability.

Method: Train a Transformer model on 100M+ SOS polynomials to predict near-minimal monomial bases, reducing SDP size. Includes systematic fallback mechanism for correctness.

Result: Validated on 200+ benchmarks with over 100x speedups compared to state-of-the-art solvers. Successfully solves instances where competing approaches fail.

Conclusion: Learning-augmented SOS certification transforms practical scalability, providing novel insights for SOS programming applications.

Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

TL;DR: This paper develops learning algorithms for identifying bias-optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes, characterizes when finite-time identification is possible, and provides a tractable stopping rule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Average gain optimality in MDPs is often too asymptotic, so the paper aims to address this by incorporating measures of immediate losses through bias optimality hierarchy up to Blackwell optimality.

Method: For each optimality order, the authors construct a learning algorithm with vanishing probability of error and provide a tractable stopping rule that triggers in finite time when possible.

Result: The paper characterizes the class of MDPs where identification algorithms can stop in finite time - those with a unique Bellman optimal policy, regardless of the optimality order considered.

Conclusion: The proposed learning algorithms can identify bias-optimal policies with vanishing error probability, and finite-time identification is possible for MDPs with unique Bellman optimal policies using the provided stopping rule.

Abstract: Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further
incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias
optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To
that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing
probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which
identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to
the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the
optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that
when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is
possible to do so.

TL;DR: DistilCLIP-EEG is a multimodal model that integrates EEG signals and text descriptions for epilepsy detection, using knowledge distillation to create a compact student model while maintaining high accuracy (>97%) across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for epilepsy detection rely only on unimodal EEG signals, missing the benefits of multimodal information integration.

Method: Proposed DistilCLIP-EEG based on CLIP framework with EEG encoder using Conformer architecture and Learnable BERT (BERT-LP) for prompt learning, operating in shared latent space. Knowledge distillation used to create compact student model.

Result: Both teacher and student models achieved >97% accuracy on TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT datasets with F1-scores consistently above 0.94. Student model has 58.1% parameter count and model size of teacher model.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework shows strong potential for EEG-based epilepsy detection and enables deployment of lightweight models in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: This paper studies offline and online reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization under local differential privacy constraints on human preference labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in RLHF for large language model alignment by providing theoretical guarantees under local differential privacy while maintaining performance.

Method: For offline setting: designed a pessimism-based algorithm with KL-regularized RLHF under single-policy concentrability. For online setting: developed an optimism-based algorithm for KL-regularized RLHF with LDP constraints.

Result: Offline: achieved suboptimality gap of Õ(1/[(e^ε-1)^2 n]) with matching lower bound. Online: derived logarithmic regret bound of O(d_F log(N_F·T)/(e^ε-1)^2) where T is time steps, N_F is reward function space cardinality, and d_F is eluder dimension variant.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first theoretical analysis of KL-regularized RLHF under local differential privacy, with optimal bounds in offline setting and logarithmic regret in online setting, while also contributing to non-private RLHF analysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

TL;DR: A data-free and computationally efficient strategy for online continual merging of LoRAs in on-device LLM deployment, enabling incremental addition of new tasks while preserving performance on previous ones under storage constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device LLM deployment faces storage limitations, requiring efficient merging of multiple LoRAs for diverse tasks. Current methods don't address the practical scenario where LoRAs are delivered incrementally as users request new tasks, creating a need for online continual merging that preserves previous task performance.

Method: Proposes a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and merging LoRAs when new ones become available, assuming limited adapter storage capacity on devices.

Result: Extensive experiments across real-world tasks demonstrate superior performance compared to alternative strategies while maintaining storage budget and computational constraints of on-device settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenge of online continual LoRA merging in resource-constrained on-device environments, enabling incremental task expansion while preserving existing capabilities.

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

### [86] [ProtoTopic: Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Medical Topic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13542)
*Martin Licht,Sara Ketabi,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoTopic is a prototypical network-based topic model that improves topic modeling for medical texts by addressing data scarcity issues through few-shot learning, outperforming traditional baselines in coherence and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling techniques perform poorly on medical texts due to limited document availability for specific healthcare topics, creating a need for models that can work effectively with small datasets.

Method: ProtoTopic uses prototypical networks that compute distances between input documents and prototype representations, making it suitable for few-shot learning scenarios in low-data medical contexts.

Result: The model demonstrates improved topic coherence and diversity compared to existing topic modeling baselines, successfully generating medically relevant topics even with limited training data.

Conclusion: ProtoTopic provides an effective solution for topic modeling in medical domains where data is scarce, leveraging prototypical networks' advantages in few-shot learning to overcome limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

### [87] [Multi-Objective $\textit{min-max}$ Online Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13560)
*Rahul Vaze,Sumiran Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends online convex optimization (OCO) to multi-objective settings with K distinct loss function sequences, introducing min-max regret as a performance measure where the algorithm must track all sequences simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional OCO considers only a single loss function sequence, but real-world scenarios often involve multiple competing objectives. The authors aim to broaden OCO's applicability by handling K distinct loss sequences and capturing tradeoffs between them through min-max regret.

Method: The authors propose a simple algorithm that combines Hedge and online gradient descent (OGD) for the i.i.d. input setting where loss functions are generated from an unknown distribution.

Result: The algorithm achieves an expected min-max regret of O(√(T log K)), where T is the time horizon and K is the number of loss sequences.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends OCO to multi-objective settings and provides an efficient algorithm with provable performance guarantees for the min-max regret criterion.

Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is
revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its
action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal
of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$
compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm
knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective
OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has
to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are
revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,
we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline
algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the
maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the
$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time
slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its
$\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$
regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret
needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where
all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the
i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known
$\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably
simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log
K})$.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across
multiple distributed clients, protecting privacy and without forgetting
previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges
balancing performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency. We
introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method
DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters

Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates
DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet

*Ivan Dubrovsky,Anastasia Orlova,Illarion Iov,Nina Gubina,Irena Gureeva,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective adversarial attacks can manipulate LLM benchmark rankings by targeting specific models while minimally affecting others, challenging the fairness of leaderboard evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, but prior work hasn't addressed whether attacks can selectively degrade or enhance specific models' performance while leaving others unaffected.

Method: Used TextAttack framework with canonical attacks on MMLU benchmark, developed a custom constraint to increase selectivity, and created a surrogate-LLM pipeline for generating selective perturbations.

Result: Found that selective adversarial attacks exist and can significantly alter relative model rankings, demonstrating that subtle edits can shift comparative judgments between models.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of leaderboard-driven evaluation, motivating the need for perturbation-aware reporting and robustness diagnostics in LLM assessment.

Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of
LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent
adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has
emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the
question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance
performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem
and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark
designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning
ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into
TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,
develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a
surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we
find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative
rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of
leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware
reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that
even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of ML and DTCO approaches in advanced nodes, which suffer from lack of diverse training data and long design flow turnaround times.

Method: Propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist generator that replicates key topological characteristics to produce realistic artificial datasets matching target parameters.

Result: In CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data augmentation improves F1 score by 0.16. In DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve PPA match up to 97.94% with full-scale block designs.

Conclusion: ArtNet effectively tackles data scarcity and TAT issues in advanced node PPA optimization, enabling more efficient design space exploration and improved ML model performance.

Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has
become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and
design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but
face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design
flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist
generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet
replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization
and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing
realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters,
ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and
design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data
augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original
(real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA
match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of
targeted full-scale block designs.

Conclusion: EEGChaT is an effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural signal relevance.

Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet
poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and
their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle
to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we
propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to
automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings.
EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information
across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to
compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate
EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with
existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy,
achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced
by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting
the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an
effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional
SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural
signal relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent sensing technologies enable collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data on complex geometric domains, but effective modeling remains challenging due to irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly predict multiple interrelated physical variables.

Method: Develop a geometry-aware multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to capture spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies, then incorporate governing physical laws through physics-based regularization to constrain predictions to be consistent with dynamical principles.

Result: Numerical experiments on 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling demonstrate that the proposed P-M-GP framework significantly improves prediction accuracy over existing methods.

Conclusion: The physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process framework effectively incorporates domain-specific physical constraints and geometric priors, enhancing model fidelity and robustness for spatiotemporal dynamic systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the
collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric

irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly
predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a
physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,
multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the
model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a
physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be
consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP
framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over
existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical
constraints and geometric prior.

*Riccardo Santi,Riccardo Salami,Simone Calderara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fast client influence removal method for federated learning using Task Arithmetic and Neural Tangent Kernel to address the need for immediate model availability during the removal process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With privacy regulations requiring client contribution removal from AI models, existing methods require multiple communication rounds which makes models unavailable during removal, causing service disruption to users.

Method: The authors introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and Neural Tangent Kernel to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

Result: The method enables fast removal of client contributions without requiring multiple communication rounds between data holders and process coordinators.

Conclusion: This approach provides an efficient solution for client influence removal in federated learning that maintains model availability during the cleansing process.

Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting
large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the
possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the
participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and
safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the
model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific
efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced
several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication
rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the
unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process,
which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we
introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural
Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,

*Riddhish Thakare,Kingdom Mutala Akugri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to add bidirectional mapping capabilities to classical NLDR methods like t-SNE and Isomap, enabling both dimensionality reduction and reconstruction. It also implements diffusion-based generation in these learned manifold spaces, but finds fundamental limitations in generative quality compared to autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical NLDR methods like t-SNE, Isomap, and LLE only provide one-way dimensionality reduction for visualization and cannot map embeddings back to original space, limiting their use in generative applications. This gap prevents their use in reconstruction and generation tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a systematic framework for constructing neural decoder architectures for prominent NLDR methods to enable bidirectional mapping. It extends this framework with diffusion-based generative processes that operate directly within the learned manifold spaces.

Result: Experiments on CelebA show that while the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Manifold-constrained diffusion yields poor-quality samples, suggesting classical NLDR embeddings' discrete and sparse nature is ill-suited for the continuous interpolation required by generative models.

Conclusion: There are inherent challenges in retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for visualization and analysis. The discrete and sparse nature of classical NLDR embeddings makes them poorly suited for the continuous interpolation needed by generative models.

Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE,
Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data
visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back
to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits
their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by
introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder
architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for
the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based
generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces.
Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and
generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard
diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while
the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by
end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion
yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of
classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation
required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in
retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for
visualization and analysis.

*Wissal Hamhoum,Soumaya Cherkaoui,Jean-Frederic Laprade,Ola Ahmed,Shengrui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a gate-based quantum reservoir computing (MTS-QRC) approach for multivariate time series forecasting that is optimized for current NISQ hardware constraints, achieving competitive performance with classical methods while showing that device noise can sometimes act as an implicit regularizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most quantum reservoir computing studies focus on univariate signals and ignore near-term hardware limitations. The authors aim to develop a practical QRC approach for multivariate time series that works with current quantum device connectivity and depth constraints.

Method: The proposed MTS-QRC uses gate-based quantum reservoir computing with paired injection and memory qubits, employing a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution specifically designed for current quantum hardware connectivity and depth limitations.

Result: On Lorenz-63 and ENSO datasets, MTS-QRC achieved MSE of 0.0087 and 0.0036 respectively, performing competitively with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and outperforming learned RNNs on both datasets. On IBM Heron R2 hardware, it maintained accuracy with realistic depths and surprisingly outperformed noiseless simulation on ENSO.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the practicality of gate-based QRC for multivariate time series forecasting on NISQ hardware and suggest that hardware noise can sometimes benefit QRC readouts by acting as an implicit regularizer, motivating further systematic studies on when and how noise can be beneficial.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to
temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook
near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for
multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and
uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized
for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method
achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively,
performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above
learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some
settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and,
interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value
analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature
directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this
regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS
forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how
hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.

Motivation: To provide a unified mathematical framework for understanding different reinforcement learning algorithms used in large language models with binary reward systems.

Method: Analyze popular RL algorithms (rejection sampling and GRPO) by showing they correspond to stochastic gradient ascent on specific monotone transformations of the probability of correct answers given prompts.

Result: Identified that rejection sampling algorithms correspond to logarithmic transformation, while GRPO algorithm corresponds to arcsine of square root transformation of the probability function.

Conclusion: Various RL algorithms for LLMs with binary rewards share a common mathematical structure as gradient ascent methods on transformed probability functions, providing theoretical unification.

Abstract: We show that several popular algorithms for reinforcement learning in large

In particular, the transformation associated with rejection sampling algorithms

TL;DR: The paper identifies critical challenges in evaluating Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), including data integrity issues, benchmarking problems, and risks of information leakage, calling for robust evaluation methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing challenges in evaluating TSFMs, particularly the difficulties in ensuring benchmark data integrity and preventing inflated performance estimates due to overlapping datasets and data leakage.

Method: The authors conducted an investigation of existing TSFM evaluation practices, analyzing issues with benchmark dataset representativeness, lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, information leakage risks, and memorization of global patterns from external shocks.

Result: Findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, leading to inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to local time series, highlighting fundamental flaws in current TSFM evaluation approaches.

Conclusion: The paper argues for developing robust evaluation methodologies to prevent pitfalls observed in LLM and classical time series benchmarking, calling for principled approaches like evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data to safeguard TSFM assessment integrity.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

TL;DR: RCS is a distribution calibration method that addresses class imbalance by estimating minority class distributions using weighted parameters from Gaussian mixtures of majority and intermediate classes, preventing overgeneralization through neighboring region data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the class imbalance problem where classifiers become biased toward majority classes due to insufficient minority class data, and to address overgeneralization issues in existing distribution calibration methods.

Method: Uses an encoder-decoder network to preserve imbalanced data structure, extracts feature vectors from encoder, and generates synthetic samples through distribution calibration strategy that leverages weighted parameters from Gaussian mixtures of majority and intermediate classes.

Result: Achieves superior classification performance compared to baseline and state-of-the-art techniques across diverse image, text, and tabular datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed RCS method effectively mitigates class imbalance issues and overgeneralization problems by calibrating distribution parameters using neighboring region data, demonstrating robust performance across multiple data types.

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

Method: Developed Axial Neural Network (XNN) inspired by parameter-sharing structures like Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks, which generalizes across tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: XNNs perform competitively with original models and show superior generalization to unseen dimensions across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models and demonstrates XNN's effectiveness in handling varying dimensionalities in physics data.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

*Bingbin Liu,Rachit Bansal,Depen Morwani,Nikhil Vyas,David Alvarez-Melis,Sham M. Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of diagonal preconditioners from Adam and Gauss-Newton methods, analyzing basis choice and gradient noise effects on optimization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when Adam-based diagonal preconditioners outperform Gauss-Newton methods and vice versa, particularly examining the impact of basis selection and stochastic gradient noise.

Method: Theoretical analysis on quadratic objectives and logistic regression across all four quadrants, comparing Adam, GN⁻¹, and GN⁻¹/² preconditioners in both full-batch and stochastic settings.

Result: Found instances where Adam outperforms both GN variants in full-batch settings regardless of basis choice. In stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN⁻¹/² for linear regression under Gaussian data assumption.

Conclusion: The choice between Adam and Gauss-Newton diagonal preconditioners depends on the optimization setting - Adam can be superior in full-batch scenarios while behaving like GN⁻¹/² in stochastic linear regression, with empirical validation on convex and non-convex objectives.

Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to
second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating
training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam
and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current
gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter
uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the
recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through
the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the
impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these
optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four
quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where
Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.
Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for
linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results
are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

*Yuchun Miao,Liang Ding,Sen Zhang,Rong Bao,Lefei Zhang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoRM addresses reward hacking in RLHF through information-theoretic reward modeling and distribution-level regularization, using Mahalanobis distance to detect and prevent reward over-optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reward misgeneralization in reward modeling and lack of suitable regularization during RL optimization, which are key obstacles in mitigating reward hacking in RLHF.

Method: Proposes InfoRM framework based on Information Bottleneck principle to filter preference-irrelevant information, and IBL regularization that penalizes deviations in IB latent space measured by Mahalanobis distance.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness across diverse LLMs and datasets, with MOP metric reliably quantifying reward hacking severity for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping.

Conclusion: InfoRM and IBL collectively advance RLHF state by providing principled solutions to reward hacking through information-theoretic approaches and statistical diagnostics.

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward
over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to
its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward
models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of
suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level
constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we
propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant
information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that
reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent
space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.
Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that
penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape
while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to
the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present
Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying
reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online
mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs
and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of
InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively
advancing the state of RLHF.

*Johan Obando-Ceron,Walter Mayor,Samuel Lavoie,Scott Fujimoto,Aaron Courville,Pablo Samuel Castro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simplicial embeddings improve RL sample efficiency by constraining representations to geometric structures, enhancing critic bootstrapping and policy gradients without runtime cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerating actor-critic methods through parallelization still requires many environment interactions. Well-structured representations can improve generalization and sample efficiency in deep RL.

Method: Propose simplicial embeddings - lightweight representation layers that constrain embeddings to simplicial structures, creating sparse and discrete features.

Result: Applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across continuous- and discrete-control environments.

Conclusion: Simplicial embeddings provide geometric inductive bias that stabilizes critic bootstrapping and strengthens policy gradients, improving RL performance without runtime overhead.

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

*Christophe Roux,Max Zimmer,Alexandre d'Aspremont,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel pruning method for Large Language Models using convex relaxation and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to minimize per-layer pruning error, outperforming existing greedy heuristics while maintaining memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM pruning methods rely on greedy heuristics that ignore weight interactions and fail to find optimal pruning masks, leading to suboptimal performance. The combinatorial nature of the pruning problem makes exact solutions intractable.

Method: The authors use convex relaxation of combinatorial constraints and solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, providing theoretical guarantees for approximate solutions through rounding.

Result: The method drastically reduces per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed convex relaxation approach with Frank-Wolfe optimization provides an effective solution to the hard combinatorial pruning problem, offering theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements for LLM pruning.

Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements
of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model
to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the
per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full
retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,
finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it
to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics
that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we
instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and
solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method
drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines
on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide
theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence
guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the
original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to
integrality.

*Carlo Saccardi,Maximilian Pierzyna,Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde,Simone Monaco,Cristian Meo,Pietro Liò,Rudolf Saathof,Geethu Joseph,Justin Dauwels*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks deep learning models for climate downscaling, revealing their poor geographic generalization and physical consistency issues, and proposes a power spectral density loss function to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional weather simulations are computationally intensive for kilometer-scale data, and while deep learning offers faster alternatives, their reliability is questionable due to evaluation primarily using standard ML metrics rather than atmospheric physics insights.

Method: Benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models using physics-inspired diagnostics, with focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency. Proposes a power spectral density loss function to improve small-scale physical structure reconstruction.

Result: Models like CorrDiff trained on limited European geographies struggle to generalize to other regions (Iberia, Morocco, Scandinavia) and fail to accurately capture second-order variables like divergence and vorticity. Deficiencies appear even in in-distribution geographies.

Conclusion: Deep learning models for climate downscaling face significant challenges in producing physically consistent predictions across different geographies. The proposed power spectral density loss function empirically improves geographic generalization by better reconstructing small-scale physical structures.

Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather
simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a
faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still
in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning
metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper
benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces
physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,
with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.
Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models
such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,
central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,
Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately
capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from
predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent
predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral
density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by
encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for
reproducing the experimental results can be found at

*Paolo Conti,Mengwu Guo,Attilio Frangi,Andrea Manzoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A progressive multi-fidelity surrogate model that sequentially incorporates diverse data types using tailored encoders and neural networks, enabling accurate predictions while maintaining performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity data is expensive and time-consuming to acquire, while low-fidelity data is more readily available but less accurate. Practical situations involve diverse data types from different modalities that may not be concurrently available, complicating surrogate modeling.

Method: Uses tailored encoders for different data types, performs multi-fidelity regression with neural networks, and employs dual connections: concatenations among encoded inputs and additive connections among final outputs to enable progressive information flow from lower to higher fidelity levels.

Result: The model reliably integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations, as demonstrated on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study.

Conclusion: The progressive multi-fidelity surrogate model effectively addresses challenges of limited high-fidelity data and diverse data modalities by enabling sequential incorporation of different data types while preventing performance degradation through its dual connection system.

Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often
expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for
applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple
scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate
models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.
Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and
encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity
information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in
practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of
different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating
the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive
multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse
data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded
inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural
networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity
levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded
inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection
system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while
ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level
without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new
input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions
based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably
integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining
performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TGPS is a tensor-GP-based solver for PDEs that uses 1D GPs along each dimension combined via tensor decomposition, enabling scalability to massive collocation sets while maintaining efficiency through ALS optimization and Newton's method for nonlinear terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing ML solvers: neural networks require inefficient stochastic training with many epochs, while traditional GP/kernel methods suffer from scalability issues with large collocation points needed for challenging/higher-dimensional PDEs.

Method: Models factor functions along each input dimension using 1D GPs, combines them via tensor decomposition, uses partial freezing strategy and Newton's method for nonlinear PDE linearization, and employs alternating least squares (ALS) with closed-form updates for efficient training.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches on several benchmark PDEs, with demonstrated scalability to massive collocation sets.

Conclusion: TGPS provides an efficient, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for solving PDEs that overcomes limitations of both neural network and traditional GP-based solvers, with proven expressivity, convergence guarantees, and error analysis.

Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have
attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural
network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and
typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process
(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from
scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often
needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that
models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs
and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.
This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,
substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to
massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and
Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating
least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby
substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical
guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof
and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on
several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy
and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first large-scale systematic study of RL scaling in LLMs, defining a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL compute scaling through sigmoidal curves and extensive ablation studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks predictive scaling methodologies for RL in LLMs comparable to those established for pre-training, despite rapidly rising compute budgets and no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute.

Method: Conducted a large-scale study (400,000+ GPU-hours) fitting sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training, ablating common design choices to analyze effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency.

Result: Found that: (1) Different recipes yield different asymptotic performance, (2) Design details primarily affect compute efficiency rather than asymptotes, (3) Stable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories enabling extrapolation. Proposed ScaleRL recipe successfully scaled to 100,000 GPU-hours with predictable validation performance.

Conclusion: Provides both a scientific framework for analyzing RL scaling and a practical recipe (ScaleRL) that brings RL training closer to the predictability achieved in pre-training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language
models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable
to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

*Ziqing Lu,Lifeng Lai,Weiyu Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an 'invincible' adversarial attack on RL systems using rate-distortion information theory to randomly manipulate observations, preventing agents from learning the true environment dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve RL system robustness against adversaries by studying uncounterable attacks, as deterministic attacks can be defeated by reversing them.

Method: Apply rate-distortion information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of transition kernel and other properties, limiting information gain about ground-truth.

Result: Derived information-theoretic lower bound on agent's reward regret and demonstrated impact on state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed rate-distortion attack is provably invincible and can be extended to other adversarial attack types like state observation attacks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.
