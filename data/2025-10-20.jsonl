In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nestimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing\nricher information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL\nalgorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the\ndistribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause\nproblems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with\ndifferent distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.\nThis study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy\nQ-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax\ncalculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather\nthan relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions\nhave similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing\npolicies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,\nand Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's\nexploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-\nLearning based C51).

To\nevaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for\nassessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of\ninstruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length\ncontrol. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and\nDeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:\nthe highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that\nfewer than $25\\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.\nNotably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades\nfurther.

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied\nto its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from\nunsound ones.

In this paper,\nwe apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models\n(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.\nAcross multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL\nconsistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing\ncoherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a\ngeneral framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable\ntasks."}

To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a\nshallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both\nstructure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function\napproximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their\nperformance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,\nrather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration\nthrough sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not\ninherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential\nconstraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer\ncollaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive\napproximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from\npreceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate\nParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.\nMoreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates\nmodel expansion for adaptive continuous learning.

The\nfirst part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in\nranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to\na counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not\nto underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee\nis extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial\nor misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over\npermissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where\nvarious off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction\nframework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise\nboth evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy\nlearning reliability.

In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework\nfor analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the\nperspective of confidence estimation.

To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a\nhybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key\ncomponents: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning.

The\nMS-VAE is domain-agnostic, and we here explore its ability to separate sources\ninto different streams using superimposed hand-written digits, and mixed\nacoustic sources in a speaker diarization task. We observe a clear separation\nof digits, and on speaker diarization we observe an especially low rate of\nmissed speakers. Numerical experiments further highlight the flexibility of the\napproach across varying amounts of supervision and training data."}

Those that\ndo exist typically hold only in restrictive settings: either they rely on\nregular or higher-order tensor representations, leading to impractically\nhigh-dimensional hidden spaces, or they target specialized architectures, often\nconfined to the invariant setting. This work develops a more general account.\nFor invariant networks, we establish a universality theorem under separation\nconstraints, showing that the addition of a fully connected readout layer\nsecures approximation within the class of separation-constrained continuous\nfunctions. For equivariant networks, where results are even scarcer, we\ndemonstrate that standard separability notions are inadequate and introduce the\nsharper criterion of $\\textit{entry-wise separability}$. We show that with\nsufficient depth or with the addition of appropriate readout layers,\nequivariant networks attain universality within the entry-wise separable\nregime. Together with prior results showing the failure of universality for\nshallow models, our findings identify depth and readout layers as a decisive\nmechanism for universality, additionally offering a unified perspective that\nsubsumes and extends earlier specialized results."}

A central question in this setting is how to\neffectively combine multiple observations in order to improve parameter\ninference and obtain sharper posterior distributions. Recent advances in\nscore-based diffusion methods address this problem by constructing a\ncompositional score, obtained by aggregating individual posterior scores within\nthe diffusion process. While it is natural to suspect that the accumulation of\nindividual errors may significantly degrade sampling quality as the number of\nobservations grows, this important theoretical issue has so far remained\nunexplored. In this paper, we study the compositional score produced by the\nGAUSS algorithm of Linhart et al. (2024) and establish an upper bound on its\nmean squared error in terms of both the individual score errors and the number\nof observations. We illustrate our theoretical findings on a Gaussian example,\nwhere all analytical expressions can be derived in a closed form."}
